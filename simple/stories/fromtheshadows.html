                                      Fighting Fantasy Adventure


Unlike other Fighting Fantasy gamebooks, From The Shadows is a collaborative project written by myself and
a group of other dedicated Fighting Fantasy forum members. The original adventure structure was split into
several small chapters, with each chapter being written separately by the contributors. Eventually, the
adventure was brought together by my humble self, playtested and edited, then brought to light, to share with
the world of gamebook readers.

Special Thanks go to Ed Jolley, Al sander, Odo_ital, Tammy Badowski and Allen Zhou, without whose
contribution this project would not have been possible.




                               From The Shadows

Deep within the foundations of the earth, a Chaos Gate is being created. Where exactly is not known. But
one thing is clear � it must be destroyed, or all manner of hellish creatures will come through. The Dark
Elves � servants of the night � have despatched four of their lieutenants across Allansia to further this
campaign. They must be found, for each holds a clue essential to locating the hidden portal. Faced with
this oncoming doom, a hero rises � YOU!

Do YOU have what it takes to stand against the agents of shadow? Can YOU destroy the portal before the
very essence of Chaos is unleashed?

Two dice, a pencil and an eraser are all you need to embark on this adventure, which comes complete
with its own elaborate combat system and a score sheet to record your progress. It is up to YOU to decide
which routes to follow, which dangers to risk and which foes to fight.


                                         INTRODUCTION


You are about to take the role in an adventure that will make you into a living legend, renowned and
respected throughout the world. Before you take part in this quest, you must first determine your own
strengths and weaknesses. You use dice to work out your initial scores. There is an Adventure Sheet at the
back of the book, which you may use to record details of your adventure. On it, you will find boxes for
recording your SKILL, STAMINA and LUCK scores. You are advised either to record your scores on the
Adventure Sheet in pencil or to make photocopies of the sheet for use in future adventures.


                                        Skill, Stamina and Luck

Roll one die. Add 6 to the number rolled and enter this total in the SKILL box on the Adventure Sheet.

Roll two dice. Add 12 to the number rolled and enter this total in the STAMINA box.

Roll one die. Add 6 to the number and enter this total in the LUCK box.

For reasons that will be explained below, all your scores will change constantly during the adventure.
You must keep an accurate record of these scores, and for this reason, you are advised to write small in
the boxes or to keep an eraser handy. However, never rub out your Initial scores, except on those very
rare occasions when the text specifically tells you so.

Although you may be rewarded additional SKILL, STAMINA and LUCK points, these totals may never
exceed your initial Scores, except on very rare occasions, when you will be instructed on a particular
page.

Your SKILL reflects your general expertise in fighting and combat � the higher the better. Your
STAMINA score reflects your general constitution, your overall will to survive, your determination and
overall fitness; the higher your STAMINA score, the longer you will be able to survive. Your LUCK
score indicates how naturally lucky a person you are. Luck � and Magic � are facts of life in the fantasy
kingdoms you are about to explore.


                                                  Battles

During your adventure, you will often come across pages in the book that instruct you to fight a creature
of some sort. An option to flee may be given, but if not � or if you choose to attack the creature anyway �
you must resolve the battle as described below.

First, record the opponent's SKILL and STAMINA scores in the first empty Encounter box on your
Adventure Sheet. The scores for each opponent or creature are given in the book each time you have an
encounter. You should also make a note of any special abilities or instructions, which are unique to that
particular opponent.


The sequence of combat is then:

1. Roll two dice for your opponent. Add its SKILL score. This total is your opponent's Attack Strength.

2. Roll two dice for yourself. Add the number rolled to your current SKILL score. This total is your
Attack Strength.

3. If your Attack Strength is higher than your opponent's is, you have wounded it. Proceed to step 4. If
your opponent's Attack Strength is higher than yours is, it has wounded you. Proceed to step 5. If both
Attack Strength totals are the same, you have avoided each other's blows � start the next Attack Round
from steps 1 above.

4. You have wounded your opponent; so subtract 2 points from its STAMINA score. You may use LUCK
here to do additional damage (see below). Proceed to step 6.

5. Your opponent has wounded you; so subtract 2 points from your STAMINA score. You may use
LUCK to reduce the loss of STAMINA (see below). Proceed to step 6.

6. Begin the next Attack Round, starting again at step 1 with your current SKILL score. This sequence
continues until the STAMINA score of either you or your opponent reaches zero (death). If your
opponent dies, you are free to continue with your adventure. If you die, your adventure ends and you must
start all over again by creating a new character.


                                                  Escaping

On some pages you may be given the option of running away from a battle should things be going badly
for you. However, if you do run away, your opponent automatically gets in one wound on you (subtract 2
STAMINA points) as you flee. Such is the price of cowardice! Note that you may use LUCK on this
wound in the normal way (see below). You may only Escape if that option is specifically given to you on
the page.


                                    Fighting More Than One Opponent

In some situations, you may find yourself facing more than one person or creature in combat and will
have to fight them all at the same time! When you find yourself fighting multiple opponents, each
adversary will make a separate attack on you in the course of each Attack Round but you can choose
which one to fight. Attack your chosen target as in a normal battle. Against any additional opponents you
roll the dice for your Attack Strength in the normal way; if your Attack Strength is greater than your
opponent's, in this instance, you will not inflict any damage � you can regard it as if you have parried an
incoming blow. If your Attack Strength is lower than your adversary's, however, you will be wounded in
the normal way.


                                                    Luck

At various times during your adventure, either in battles or when you come across other situations in
which you could either be Lucky or Unlucky (details of these are given in the relevant pages themselves),
you may use LUCK to make the outcome more favourable to you. However, beware! Using LUCK is a
risky business and, if you are unlucky, the results could be disastrous.

The procedure for using your luck is as follows: roll two dice. If the number rolled is less than or equal to
your current LUCK score, you have been Lucky and the outcome will be in your favour. If the number
rolled is higher than your current LUCK score, you have been Unlucky and will be penalised.

This procedure is known as Testing your Luck. Each time you Test your Luck, you must subtract 1 point
from your current LUCK score. Thus, you will soon realise that, the more you rely on your LUCK, the
more risky this procedure will become.


                                           Using Luck in Battles

On certain pages of the book, you will be told to Test your Luck, and will be told the consequences of
your being Lucky or Unlucky. However, in battles you always have the option of using your LUCK either
to inflict more serious damage on an opponent you have just wounded or to minimise the effects of a
wound you have just received.

If you have just wounded an opponent, you may Test your Luck as described above. If you are Lucky, you
have inflicted a severe wound; deduct an extra 2 points from your opponent's STAMINA score.
However, if you are Unlucky, however, your blow only scratches your opponent, and you deduct only 1
point from your opponent's STAMINA (instead of scoring the normal 2 points of damage, you now only
score 1).

Whenever you yourself are wounded in combat, you may Test your Luck to try to minimise the wound. If
you are Lucky, your opponent's blow only grazes you; deduct only 1 point from your STAMINA. If you
are Unlucky, your wound is a serious one and you must deduct 1 extra STAMINA point (i.e., a total of 3
points from your own STAMINA). Remember: you must subtract 1 point from your LUCK score each
time you Test your Luck.


                                       More about your Attributes

                                                     Skill

Your SKILL score will not change much during the course of your adventure. Occasionally a paragraph
may give you instructions to increase or decrease your SKILL score, but it may not exceed its Initial
value unless you are specifically instructed to the contrary.

At various times during your adventure, you will be told to Test your Skill. The procedure for this is the
same as that for Testing your Luck: roll two dice. If the number rolled is less than or equal to your current
SKILL score, you have succeeded in your test and the result will go in your favour. If the number rolled
is higher than your current SKILL score, you have failed the test and will have to suffer the consequences.
However, unlike Testing your Luck, do not subtract 1 point from your SKILL each time you Test your
Skill. Your SKILL score can never exceed its initial value unless specifically instructed on a page.


                                                   Stamina

Your STAMINA score will change a lot during your adventure. It will drop because of wounds received
through combat, or by falling foul of traps and pitfalls; and it will drop after you perform any particularly
arduous task. If your STAMINA score ever falls to zero or below, you have been killed and should stop
reading the book immediately. Brave adventurers who wish to pursue their quest must roll up a new
character and start all over again.

There will be (rare) occasions when you will be told to Test your STAMINA. The procedure for this is a
little different from the procedures required when Testing your Luck or Testing your SKILL; and is as
follows: roll four dice. If the number rolled is less than or equal to your current STAMINA score, you
have succeeded in your test and the result will go in your favour. If the number rolled is higher than your
current STAMINA score, you have failed the test and will have to suffer the consequences. However,
unlike Testing your Luck, do not subtract 1 point from your STAMINA each time you Test your
STAMINA.


                                                     Luck

Additions to your LUCK score may be awarded in the adventure when you have been particularly lucky
or created your own luck by some other action. Details are given, where appropriate, in the paragraphs of
the book. Remember that, as with SKILL and STAMINA, your LUCK score may never exceed its initial
value unless specifically instructed on a page.


                                                Special Note

There will be times during your adventure when you will come across an unusually dangerous situation
and your SKILL, STAMINA or LUCK will be tested to the full; for example you may be instructed to
Test your Skill, `adding 2 to the number rolled'. This simply means that when you roll two dice you must
add 2 to the total; if you had rolled a 1 and a 3, for example, your modified total would be 6 (1 + 3 + 2 =
6). You then compare this outcome with your current SKILL score to discover whether you have
succeeded in the test.


                                                    Food

Every adventuring warrior knows that food is vital as a form of sustenance. You begin with ten meals
worth of Provisions. You may find opportunities to obtain more Provisions but you may never carry more
than ten. There is one point to remember in using these vital supplies: the text will instruct that you must
eat a meal at certain times in your adventure. This means you'll have to erase one meal automatically
without gaining STAMINA! Venturing into any adventure may prove arduous indeed; therefore you need
food just to keep your strength up. This then leads to a second possibility: if you have no Provisions and
the text tells you to eat a meal, you must reduce your STAMINA by 3 points! Any other time you choose
to eat a meal, you may restore 4 lost STAMINA points, except during combat or when performing any
other similar action.


                                         Equipment and Potions

You will start your adventure with a bare minimum of equipment, but you may find or buy other items
during your travels. You are dressed in leather armour, possess a money pouch to hold Gold Pieces, and
have a backpack to hold your Provisions and any other items you may come across. You also carry a
lantern to light your way in the dark, and a sword of the finest steel. These items are also covered in
paragraph 1 along with a few others. If you find other weapons, you may take them with you but only one
may be used during combat.

You do not start with any Potions but you may be lucky enough to obtain some later. Potions have many
effects but the most common are used to restore your Attributes. Each bottle of potion contains enough
for one measure. Remember to cross it off your Adventure Sheet when you choose to drink it. You may
do this at any time (except during combat).

If you ever have items you no longer wish to keep, you may discard them at any time. Simply cross the
item from your Adventure Sheet. Obviously, if the text asks if you possess a certain item, it will be too
late to discard it.


                                              Hints on Play

This adventure is dangerous. You might well fail on your first attempt. Make notes and draw a map as
you explore � this map will prove invaluable when making further forays in this adventure, and it will
enable you to progress more rapidly to unexplored sections. Remember: when you are travelling through
any environment, it is a good idea to make a note of where such encounters lie in the adventure ahead,
including useful objects and information to aid you on your dangerous quest.

Be wary about testing your Luck, unless a paragraph instructs you to do this! When it comes to fights,
you should Test your Luck only to keep yourself alive if an opponent's blow would otherwise kill you.
However, be warned! If you decide to use Luck in this way, be certain your adversary is worth it � LUCK
points are precious!

You start this mission with very few possessions, but will be given opportunities to collect food, weapons,
and items. However, choose your equipment carefully - although many are precious or magical, others are
red herrings and of no real value at all.

You will soon realise that paragraphs make no sense if read in numerical order. It is essential that you
read only the paragraphs you are instructed to go to. Reading other sections lessens the excitement and
surprise during play. The only true way to success in this adventure involves minimal risk; even if your
character scores are low, you should be able to find magical artefacts and weapons that may increase your
chances of victory in battle.

                                              BACKGROUND


You can tell that something is wrong even as the caravan draws near to the town of Stonebridge.
You work for the trader Tareg Villett, protecting him and his wares as he takes them around the towns
and villages scattered throughout the Pagan Plains. Normally, a crowd starts to gather as soon as the
caravan comes into view of its next destination, the locals eager to see what Tareg has for sale, and to
hear the latest gossip from elsewhere in the region. Today the Dwarves of Stonebridge look wary, even
fearful, and only a small group of armed guards assembles to greet you.
Seeing this, Tareg reins in his horses a safe distance from the town. &quot;Get out and see what's the matter
with them,&quot; he orders you.
Taking care not to make any moves that might be misinterpreted as hostile, you approach the guards.
&quot;What do you want here?&quot; calls out a Dwarf with streaks of grey in his beard.
You explain that Tareg has come to sell his wares, and the Dwarf says they'll only let the caravan past if
Tareg lets them check it first. Reluctantly, Tareg agrees to this, and two of the Dwarves clamber into the
back of the caravan, emerging moments later to pronounce its contents safe.
The guard with the grey-streaked beard tells Tareg he can come in. As the caravan begins to move once
more, you ask what the guards were checking for.
&quot;Dark Elves,&quot; mutters a guard with a large nose, and spits on the ground.
Gradually the whole story comes out. Somewhere in this part of the country, an army of Dark Elves is
assembling with the intent of taking over the whole region. Their leader, an evil Sorcerer by the name of
Malbordus, is attempting some kind of Dragon-summoning magic to add to their strength. Yaztromo, a
good Wizard who lives somewhere to the south, found a champion to confront Malbordus, but there has
been no news of how this champion has fared. Under the circumstances, it's hardly surprising that the
locals aren't particularly interested in trading.
Unwilling to risk running into a Dark Elf raiding party, Tareg decides to stay in Stonebridge for now.
Leaving you to tend to the horses, he stomps off in search of a tavern.
You have just finished dealing with the horses when a voice cries, &quot;It's Yaztromo! He's coming here
again!&quot;
You hurry to join the crowd that is assembling to meet him, everyone hoping for good news, fearful of
bad. It soon becomes almost impossible to make out anything in the babble of voices, but everyone falls
silent when Yaztromo finally reaches the town square.
&quot;Malbordus is dead,&quot; announces the Wizard, and a massive cheer erupts from the crowd, dying away
quickly as he glares at everybody through his spectacles.
&quot;That doesn't mean the danger's over,&quot; he continues. &quot;Far from it, as a matter of fact. A good army is
something like a Hydra - cut off its head, and it grows another one.&quot; For a moment he pauses, lost in
thought. &quot;Actually a Hydra grows back two heads for every one you cut off, so they're not exactly the
same. Still the point is that if a good army loses its leader, it doesn't fall apart, it just appoints a new one.
And, judging by what I've managed to find out concerning this new leader, this one is just as dangerous as
Malbordus was. Maybe even more so.&quot;
&quot;This morning an attempt was made on my life, using a magic arrow, engraved with the Rune of Death. If
my crow hadn't spotted the assassin and warned me, I doubt that I'd be here now.&quot;
&quot;Did you catch him?&quot; asks one of the Dwarves.
&quot;Of course I did. A Dark Elf archer. He wouldn't talk, of course, but I know a mind-reading spell, and he
couldn't completely block that. He put up a good fight, though. Must have been trained by an expert. And
I won't be able to find out any more from him, either. While I was recovering from casting the spell, he
managed to get to a poisoned needle he had hidden in his jerkin, and killed himself. But I had enough
fragments to piece together the Dark Elf army's new plan.&quot;
The Wizard pauses, but this time nobody else dares break the silence, and after a moment he carries on.
&quot;Their new leader is a High Priest, and he appears to be trying to open up a Chaos Gate. There's not a lot
known about such things as, fortunately, whenever anyone's been fool enough to try and create one,
they've been prevented from completing it. But it's clear enough that if one ever is opened, it will let all
manner of monstrosities through from somewhere in the depths of hell. For such a portal to exist, its
creator would undoubtedly require an extensive base of operations to perform the necessary vile rituals in
secret. The trouble is I wasn't able to find out where this one's being built.&quot;
Several of the crowd gasp upon hearing this, and Yaztromo flaps his hands at them. &quot;Oh, there's still hope.
Silzedel, my would-be killer, isn't the only member of the Dark Elf army who's out and about. He was just
one of four lieutenants who've been sent out to cause trouble, and the other three are still at large, as far as
I can tell. Find them, and we may have a chance of finding the Chaos Gate before it's too late. They
should all have one of these.&quot; He holds up what looks to you like a large discoloured tooth. &quot;While I
haven't been able to completely decipher the runes inscribed on it, I could at least ascertain that the
correct word of command will cause this to transport its bearer to the Gate. I'm sure I could find out a lot
more about the spell if I had the rest of the teeth. Maybe even just one or two more of them. So all we
need,&quot; he gives a short, bitter laugh, &quot;is for someone to find the other lieutenants and acquire the teeth
they carry. It's just a pity that my young friend who took care of Malbordus isn't back from the Desert of
Skulls yet. We really can't afford to wait for...&quot;
&quot;I'll go!&quot; In the shocked silence that follows the interruption, you realise that the voice which spoke up is
your own. You catch sight of Tareg over to one side of the crowd, looking displeased, and feel a strange
sense of satisfaction.
&quot;Oh?&quot; Yaztromo peers at you and beckons you towards him. &quot;And who might you be? No, don't tell me,
it doesn't matter. More to the point, what makes you think that you're up to the challenge? Have you even
faced any Dark Elves before now?&quot;
&quot;No,&quot; you admit, and add. &quot;But I once fought off a Hill Troll raiding party single-handed.&quot; A feeling of
shame overcomes you as soon as you speak these words. How foolish and insignificant that fight, your
greatest triumph, must seem to someone as powerful as Yaztromo.
Tareg gives a snort of derision at your embarrassment, but to your surprise he is immediately shushed by
several of the Dwarves around him, and you hear muttered expressions of approval from those closest to
you.
The wizard is smiling as well. &quot;Whether or not you have the skill for this quest, you certainly have the
courage. It takes a lot to admit to everyone that you've never fought any Dragons or Demons or the like.
Such courage may not be enough, of course, but it's a good start. Now, I'm not sure exactly where any of
these other lieutenants are, but I've managed to narrow it down to just five probable locations. The sooner
you start searching, the better.&quot;
He fumbles in his robes for a roll of parchment. &quot;Here's a map with them all on. They're all quite some
distance from here, so you'd better get a move on. And... Hold on a moment, where did I put that... Ah!&quot;
He holds up a copper ring. &quot;Yes, this will allow you to communicate with me over long distances. But it
only has a few charges, so you'd better use it very sparingly. Don't try to contact me until your search is
over. If you can get hold of the other teeth, I should be able to find the right general area and cast a spell
that will transport you there.&quot;
You take the map and the ring from Yaztromo, and promise to do your best to find the location of the
Chaos Gate.
&quot;You do that. And if you can stop the lieutenants from doing whatever it is that they're up here to do, so
much the better. They're all up to no good, no question of that. Oh, and maybe you should have this, too.&quot;
He drops the tooth into your hand. Studying it, you see that the discolouration is actually a series of seven
elongated runes inscribed upon it. If you do obtain any more of these teeth, make a note of the number of
sigils they bear.
&quot;Anyway,&quot; concludes Yaztromo, &quot;it's about time you were on your way.&quot;
Wondering what you might have got yourself into, you unroll the map.
Turn to paragraph 1.
</div>
<div id="1">
                                                      1
Yaztromo has circled the five locations where the other lieutenants might be in red ink, so they
immediately catch your eye. Two are near the top of the map, the third is about half way down and on the
left, and the others are close to the bottom.
&quot;That's Stonebridge, by the way,&quot; adds Yaztromo, indicating a spot close to the middle of the map with a
gnarled fingernail. It lies roughly to the north of Yaztromo's tower in Darkwood Forest.
Looking more closely at the red circles, you identify the names within them. The first, almost directly
north of Stonebridge, is Fang, infamous for the dungeon that has claimed the lives of so many adventurers.
Some way east of Fang is a place called Zengis. The name means nothing to you. You've definitely heard
of the one to the west, though. Port Blacksand is notorious for being filled with criminals, none worse
than its ruler, Lord Azzur. By contrast, Salamonis, in the south, is renowned for the goodness of its king.
As for Warpstone, roughly east of Salamonis, that is as much of a mystery to you as Zengis.
&quot;Try to be methodical in your search,&quot; advises Yaztromo. &quot;I don't know how much time we have before
the Chaos Gate is ready, so the quicker you can find the lieutenants, the better. Now, it's high time you
were on your way.&quot;
Within a few minutes you are ready to go. You have your sword, your backpack, a lantern, 10 portions of
Provisions, a pouch of 20 Gold Pieces, and map, tooth-piece and Copper Ring from Yaztromo. Most of
the Dwarves of Stonebridge assemble to see you off and wish you luck, though Tareg is nowhere to be
seen. Probably getting drunk in some tavern, the miserable old so-and-so.
The crowd cheers as you head out of the town square, and you hope that their confidence in you will not
prove misplaced.
Which way will you head out of Stonebridge?
North, across the Pagan Plains towards Fang and Zengis (turn to 178)
South, past Darkwood Forest towards Salamonis and Warpstone (turn to 267)
West to Port Blacksand (turn to 63)

As the gap between the falling block and the floor narrows you leap through the remaining space. You
feel the force of the stone crash into the floor beyond but you wild dive has got you through safely.
Although you have survived you know you have cut down your options considerably. If there is no other
way out you will be doomed, even if you complete your mission. The only way onwards is through the
tunnel stretching out ahead. Turn to 141.

Though more accustomed to sailing the seas that going inland, the ship's crew expertly manoeuvre the Sea
Horse into the River Kok, and you are soon heading east towards your next port of call. If you have
already been to Fang, turn to 280.
Otherwise, the voyage up river is problem-free until the afternoon, at which point the look-out warns of a
barge apparently abandoned and adrift up ahead, almost blocking the way. Captain Tully asks for some
volunteers to go over to the barge in one of the lifeboats and move it to the bank, where it will not pose a
hazard to any other vessels on the river. As they crowd into the lifeboat, you see that there's room for one
more person in it.
If you wish to accompany them to the drifting barge and try to find out what has happened aboard it, turn
to 298. If you would rather stay on the Sea Horse and let the sailors attend to the barge on their own, turn
to 80.

                                                       4
You head away from the market square and soon encounter several excited folk talking about a part of the
city that has just collapsed down some sort of hole in the ground. Up ahead you see a crooked sign
marking the entrance to 'The Black Dragon' tavern and wanting to find out more about the local
disturbance you enter, finding yourself in a disreputable, dully lit room. The windows are encrusted in
filth and let in little light. The taverns numerous patrons are not much cleaner either. You wind your way
through the various cut-throats and vagabonds towards the counter. You are leaning across the bar top to
attract the barkeep's attention, when the door of the tavern bursts open. There is a moment of absolute
silence as the patrons of the tavern take in the sight of three Skeletal Warriors standing in the doorway,
scanning the room with sunken, light-consuming eyes. Then the screaming starts and all pandemonium
breaks loose. Turn to 349.

You push your way through the crowds and their festivities. Ahead of you, priests of Dalgalla have set up
games of chance. The press of people around the games slows your progress. You work your way around
the edge of the crowd and pass close to a simple enclosed stall marked &quot;Madame Star, Clairvoyant&quot;. A
short, plump woman in brightly coloured clothes pokes her head out and motions you across to her.
&quot;Adventurer. Cross my palms with gold and I will tell you your fortune.&quot; At your sceptical look she
exclaims, &quot;Let me tell you a little of your fortune now and you can determine yourself if it is worth the
payment for the rest.&quot; A look of concentration comes over her face and in a sharp voice that cuts through
the noise of the crowd she exclaims. &quot;You are on a quest... you have come to Blacksand searching for an
item of... no, for a person, someone shrouded in deep mystery. You believe they may be in Blacksand but
do not know for sure.&quot; She shakes her head as if to clear it. If you want to pay 2 Gold Pieces for Madame

You lunge for him. He does not speak. He simply gathers his power and waves a hand in your direction.
You feel his magic envelop you, tearing at your very soul. Test your Luck. If you are Unlucky, your body
and soul are destroyed, leaving behind a light scattering of dust to mark your utter annihilation. If you are
Lucky, lose 1-6 points (roll one die) worth of STAMINA. The force of his magic blinds you momentarily.

The three approaching guards don't appear suspicious otherwise they'd have bows ready rather than whips.
They lash out at the nearest bunch of Dwarfs whom have already been freed but forced to stifle their
building anger.
&quot;What's wrong here?&quot; barks the taller of the Dark Elves. &quot;Get back to work or it's the pit for all of you.
Our pet always needs to feed, don't you forget.&quot;
They casually scan the workers for fault and you do your best to remain nonchalant as their gaze moves
slowly round to you. Thinking quickly, the Dwarf pushing the cart claims one of the wheels is jammed
diverting their attention. The guards walk over to investigate and you give the Dwarf a nod of thanks.
Now is your chance to act. Releasing the last of the slaves, you signal the attack. In mere moments, the
guards have fallen to a barrage of blows. But the danger is far from over. A high-pitched resonance
suddenly fills the tunnels.
&quot;The alarm!&quot; Damon curses. &quot;They know we're free. The rest of them are alerted to our presence. You'd
better deal with that witch while you still can. We have unfinished business here.&quot; Many guards arrive

Unfortunately, while the court can understand that adventurers sometimes carry the odd dark and deadly
item, the number you carry convinces them that you may well just be the villain described by the grand
counsellor. The king orders for your immediate arrest. You protest your innocence but your voice falls on
deaf ears. Palace guards drag you down to the dungeons where you are locked away for an indefinite

Elves from opening the Chaos Gate. Your quest has failed.

Dwight's Wharf district appears to be devoid of shops, only residential areas for high-class folk and a very
large house in a cul-de-sac. The streets are practically deserted. As you are leaving the block, you see a
hairless canine scoot from around the corner and bolt like a frightened animal would, but in your direction.
Closer up, you realize it is not much of a dog - more like some sort of experiment gone awry, or maybe
the pet of a twisted sorcerer. It has no eyes that you can make out, but its acute sense of smell picks up
your scent. The thing looks starved and growls wildly, intent on making you its long-awaited meal.

&quot;You have done well to hunt down two of the three agents of evil,&quot; Yaztromo says rather impressed,
&quot;Though that does mean that one Dark Elf lieutenant is still at large. But let us not worry about that since
there are more pressing matters at hand. Quickly now, tell me of these discoveries.&quot;
You describe the tooth-pieces for the wizard to continue his research. Restore 4 points of STAMINA and
2 points of LUCK for your accomplishment.
&quot;I have it!&quot; you hear as the ring crackles back into life. Eager to get going, you ask Yaztromo if he has
found the Chaos Gate. &quot;Yes. Well...no, not exactly - more like an indication. We have been searching for
the lieutenants across Allansia hoping that one of them would be crucial to finding the Dark Elf
headquarters in one of the bigger cities. In a way, we have been led on a wild goose chase. The base isn't
out there at all. It's here, in Darkwood!&quot;
You sigh despondently. So you know the portal is in a base somewhere in Darkwood which, of course,
would take days to reach and weeks to search its entirety.
&quot;Stop fretting for a moment,&quot; Yaztromo continues, &quot;Did I say I was finished? The base is on the western
edge of Darkwood but something or someone is blocking my magic. I can't get an exact location so I'm
afraid you will have to discover it by yourself. The tooth-pieces you hold originate from the same location
as the Chaos Gate. I can sense their magic and tap into it, weak though it is, through the copper ring. And
through my studies, I have learnt a Tooth Warp spell that can transport you most of the way there to avoid
some of the dangers of Darkwood Forest. I may be able to guide you when you are closer to the portal.
Alternatively, if you are running low on supplies I could teleport you to my tower where you can rest and
restock. Of course, that would mean you having to go through the forest on your own. Either way, you are
quite a distance away and carry a lot on your person. I suggest you'd better lose some baggage in order for
the spell to work.&quot;

You can take with you no more than 12 items of equipment. Each portion of Provisions counts as one
item but your pouch of gold can be treated as a single item. Rings, keys and tooth-pieces are light enough
to be negligible. Do not count your backpack or clothing either. Everything else counts as one item each.
Decide what you wish to take or leave behind and amend your Adventure Sheet accordingly. When you
are finished, you inform Yaztromo that you are ready to receive his spell.

If you want to be transported to the tower, turn to 389 immediately.
If you would rather be transported into the forest, all goes hazy and then you find yourself in Darkwood.
Recovering from the effects, you observe your new surroundings. Turn to 74.

You see the crew of a barge making preparations for heading down river, and decide to see if you can get
a lift with them and save yourself some time. The Captain, a man barely taller than the average Dwarf,
says he can take you as far as Fang, but unless you want to work your passage, it'll cost you 5 Gold Pieces.
If you are willing to pay that much, the fare does include a bland but filling meal, and you may add 2
STAMINA points for the night's rest. If you would rather work, you will get no rest for the night, and
must eat your own food: deduct one portion of Provisions or lose 3 STAMINA points for going hungry.
Early the next morning, the barge reaches Fang. If that is your intended destination, turn to 131. If you are

You step over to tend to the young man bleeding on the ground. Fortunately he only suffered mild injuries
and he is capable of standing after getting over the shock. &quot;Thank you my friend. Those brutes would
have surely killed me if you hadn't shown up.&quot; You ask him why they were attacking him and he replies,
&quot;Well it seems that I'm a bit too nosy for my own good. I work in the mines as an overseer of the mining
operation. I make sure that we make a decent quota, and I'm in charge of choosing where the dig is to take
place. As you can probably guess the mines are very big, and we have had a few problems with creatures
from the mountains coming in and making lairs in the mines. So, I send out guards to patrol the working
areas to make sure they are safe. We also block off disused parts of the mine to prevent them from
coming in, but they slip through sometimes. One day, I was making some rounds asking the guards if the
place was secure, and we were very close to a blocked off section, when I heard voices coming from
behind the barrier. Our barriers are usually quickly made so there are often holes where you can look
through, and I saw three figures standing there talking. I could make out only a few words: 'slaves', 'on the
other side', 'lieutenant'. That seemed very strange to me, since normally the mines are deserted except for
the occasional animal. I guess I shouldn't have asked all those questions about them around the town.
They must have spies here.&quot; This could be something to do with the Dark Elves you are looking for, so
you ask him how to get into the mines. &quot;Well, there are no visitors allowed in the working area of the
mines, but there are many abandoned entrances scattered across the mountains. Without a map, you'd be
lost for sure. Tell you what. My father is a mine inspector and one of the few people with access to a map
of the entire tunnel network. If you go to The Green Gem Inn, he should be there most of the afternoon
and he can give you a map. Here, have this. Tell him how you helped me, and he should have no problem
giving you the map.&quot; He pins a small Bronze Star on to your tunic.
&quot;Of course, it would be helpful if you knew which tunnels they use, but I don't know unfortunately. By
the way the name is Silek, and thank you once again for saving my life.&quot; With that he shakes your hand
and leaves the alley. You stand alone for a moment considering the information he has given you, and
what luck it would be if he was right. Gain 1 LUCK point for this meeting. You leave the alley and
continue up Opal Street. Turn to 294.

The man at the table is too busy gulping down a jug of something to notice you approach and sit down
near him. When he finally lowers the empty jug alongside four others, he shudders slightly upon seeing
you there. He reminds you of a wizard: long white hair and long white beard. His eyes are green and
slightly foggy.
&quot;What do you want?&quot; he asks. All you do is shrug your shoulders, somewhat bemused. &quot;Listen. I am not
going anywhere with you! Get that through your thick head!&quot;
The innkeeper brings him another jug filled to the brim with alcohol. &quot;Do not sit here listening to him. He
is a demented old man. He has been in here every day spending off his coins and making me rich enough
to buy another pot. Some stew, adventurer?&quot;
&quot;Silence!&quot; screams the elder, and the innkeeper simply laughs to himself and struts off. &quot;It was he, the
coward, who was to go into that dungeon not my son in his place. He never came out of there. They won't
tell me what happened to him!&quot; He lowers his voice a bit. &quot;If you would kindly venture into that dungeon
and retrieve information about my lost son, I will reward you with five hundred gold coins and shops in
Zengis all your own. I am the wealthiest man alive!&quot;
The innkeeper yells across the room, &quot;He babbles such tales to everyone. Yesterday, he claimed his son
was turned into a monkey by Black Elves.&quot;
&quot;Adventurer, Baron Sukumvit is indebted to me. I crafted him that sword with my bare frail hands! I let
him use my son as a dungeon-walker, and what did I get in return? Nothing! I am a blacksmith not a
drunkard. I try to walk with my chin up.&quot;
You rise slowly as he rants on and on about himself and his son.
&quot;If you can attain that sword from him and give it back to me, I will be the happiest fellow alive! I will
take that sword and run the baron through his heart!&quot;
You ask him what the sword looks like.
&quot;Oh...it's been years...I cannot remember...there was a distinctive red gem on it...&quot; His eyelids start to
droop and saliva stretches down from his lower lip. You know you won't be able to get any more

Surely the man you rescued from the Chaos Abomination couldn't be... But as you describe what
happened in the mines and then give his description, the woman lets out a shriek of joy. You notice the
young man behind her has stopped his scribing and is staring at you in astonishment.
&quot;For saving my husband, you must accept this gift.&quot; She is pulling out an amulet from one of the draws as
she speaks. &quot;It was supposed to be for young Faren here, to keep him safe if he ever followed in his
father's footsteps, but it will be of more use to you.&quot;
She hands you the Crystal Amulet and explains its powers to you. If you need to Test your Luck to avoid
the effects of hostile magic and fail your LUCK roll, the amulet will activate. Instead of failing the roll,
the magic from the amulet will allow you to progress as if you had succeeded. It will also raise your

No sooner have you flipped the card over than a cloud of billowing smoke is released. You jump back
with a start. From the depths of gathering darkness you hear a scream, and are startled again when a body
suddenly drops out from within the smoke. It is the wizard you have come to see and he has been foully
slain. You face the darkness once more. It is taking the form of some skeletal winged-beast with fangs

wine, while the master thief relates what he knows. Restore 2 STAMINA points.
Disappointingly, the thieves of Port Blacksand have not noticed any Dark Elf activity within their city and
the master thief proclaims boldly that if they don't know about any activity, then there is none. He can
give you one lead however. He explains that they are in contact with a guild much like their own in
Salamonis (except smaller and poorly run, he mutters). That guild has reported some &quot;unusual&quot; decisions
being made at the highest level in the city as well as a determined effort to cause unrest amongst the
common people by person or persons unknown. &quot;It could be one of your Dark Elf lieutenants causing
trouble.&quot; Restore 1 LUCK point if you have not yet been to Salamonis.

rest. How about a drink on the house?&quot; He brings you a mug of ale and places it in front of you. Do you
want to drink and perhaps start up a conversation (turn to 189), or say that all you want is a room for the
night (turn to 256)?

As you approach the three men they stop talking and look up at you. One of them looks at you with
distrust.
&quot;What do you want?&quot; he snarls. You tell them that you are new to the city and that you are looking for
rumours about anything strange happening. &quot;The only strange thing that happens here is people walking
up and interrupting decent people in their conversations. Leave us alone.&quot;
If you are wearing a small bronze star, turn to 374 immediately.
If not, they do not wish to talk to you and you must choose another course of action that you have not
tried before. You can either talk to the bartender (turn to 115), order a meal and talk to the man and
woman (turn to 43), or ask the men if you may join them in a game of dice (turn to 395).

You leave the room and enter the downward sloping passage. You have only got a short distance when
you hear a terrifying grinding of stone on stone. A huge stone block falls from the ceiling. You try to leap
out of its way but you simply cannot move fast enough to get out from underneath before the block strikes
you.
If you possess the Dragonstone Sceptre, turn to 288 immediately.

You arrive at Sapphire Street at the agreed time. You see Borak sitting on a chair on the porch in front of
his house and hold up your hand in greeting. He smiles and invites you to sit down offering you a glass of
something he calls Crystal Water. You accept and it tastes a lot like lemon juice which actually cools you
down and makes the warm evening almost unfelt.
&quot;Well my friend, I hope you have enjoyed you're stay in Warpstone so far. I hope you haven't had any
more interesting encounters since you rescued Silek.&quot;
You smile and tell him that the rest of your stay has been a lot duller. He lets out a laugh but then
develops a more serious look in his eyes.
&quot;But you are not here for small talk. You are here for this.&quot; He reaches behind him a finds a cylindrical
metal container. &quot;Here is the map that we agreed upon, but I still cannot get you access to the mines.&quot;
You take the container and tell him that you will find a way to get in. Record the Map of the Mines on
your Adventure Sheet.
&quot;Well good luck to you. Come back and visit sometime.&quot; You thank him and leave the house. It is time to
enter the mines. Turn to 378.

You bear slightly to the west as you head southwards through the Moonstone Hills. Though this part of
Allansia is said to be home to all manner of dangerous creatures, and you find some evidence to support
that claim when you pass the skeletal remains of a humanoid around three times your size, nothing
troubles you during the day. At night you must make camp once more. You must eat a meal.
Continuing your journey the following day, you make it out of the Moonstone Hills without incident, and
towards evening you reach a farming village. On the outskirts you encounter a young couple, who tell you
that the name of the village is Coven and give you directions to the local tavern, where you can get a meal
and a room for the night for 3 Gold Pieces. Make a note on your Adventure Sheet that you have been to
Coven.
If you want to go to the tavern, and can afford the price, turn to 177. If you would rather sleep beneath the
stars, or poverty compels you to do so, you make camp outside the village. You must eat a meal.

The silence is abruptly broken by a loud rumbling from above and behind you. Looking back over your
shoulder, you see that one of the boulders is toppling down the hillside, and a moment later it comes to
rest with an earth-shaking crash. This valley is starting to look less picturesque and more dangerous, but it
will not be easy to go back with that boulder blocking the way, so you decide to press on through it
quickly.
Before you have gone very far, you hear another rumble, and look up to see a second boulder tumbling
towards you. Test your Skill. If you succeed, turn to 341. If you fail, you do not react quickly enough. The
boulder lands on top of you, crushing you into the ground.

Between the towering mountains of the Craggen Heights to your right and the seemingly endless stretch
of the Flatlands to your left, you feel small and isolated, and this sensation only grows as you make your
solitary way south. You see the occasional scurrying thing in the mountains, and on a couple of occasions
you glimpse a lone horseman far away to the east, but apart from that you witness no signs of life. Your
journey across the edge of the Flatlands lasts two days and two nights, during which time you must use
two portions of Provisions without gaining any STAMINA, or lose 3 STAMINA points for each missed
meal. It is a mixed blessing that although there is not enough food to forage for out here, you also do not
meet anything nasty on the way. In fact, the only thing you come across is a single Gold Piece which you
accidentally kick up but eagerly take. It's too bad that you cannot eat it.
If you survive this bleak trek, on the third morning you make out the shape of a town up ahead. More
ominously, a little further on you also find a dead man in tattered rags, starved and dirty-skinned, with
rusted shackles on his bony wrists and ankles, lying in a shallow ditch at the side of the track. You cannot
do anything for him, as even if you could spare the time, the ground is too hard to dig a grave, and there
are too few small stones around to build a cairn. Trying to shake off the sense of foreboding that hangs
over you like a shadow, you press on towards the town. Turn to 345.

&quot;Hey, cut that out,&quot; you hear yourself say, stirring from your slumber. Some inquisitive, furry animal is
nuzzling your face. Lethargically, you peel your eyes open. It could be a dog or a cat perhaps. Or, blast! A
RAT! You hurriedly brush away the foul creature and sit bolt upright. You are not prepared, however, for
the shock in store for you. The entire room is crawling with huge black rats and centipedes the size of
your arm! Rotting corpses of men are strewn amongst them. If you don't act fast, you could end up like
them. Will you:

Stay on the bed and fight? Turn to 133.

Add 2 LUCK points for vanquishing the lieutenant. Searching his possessions, you find: a pouch
containing 5 Gold Pieces; two portions of bitter-tasting yet highly nutritious Provisions; an empty glass
bottle; and one of the tooth-pieces you are looking for. This one is patterned with ten contours. You take

Otherwise, you head down to the bank of the river, where you pause to consider your next course of
action. Close by, two men are chatting as they watch a group of sailors loading a barge, and suddenly two
words stand out to you from their conversation: 'Dark Elf'. Paying closer attention to the discussion, you
learn that the man speaking was engaged by a Dark Elf to transport a crate containing some kind of
animal to Fang.
If you have not yet been to Fang, you cannot afford to ignore this lead, and had better go there as quickly
as possible (turn to 11).
If you have already investigated Fang, you would gain nothing by returning there, and must turn your

Aiming carefully, you send the missile whizzing towards him. He clasps his neck with a stifled cry - a
successful hit! However, your delight becomes dismay as the Dark Elf plucks out the dart regaining his
composure. He spins round to look in your direction.
&quot;I see you skulking, coward,&quot; he spits. &quot;Poison cannot harm Targamis the Mighty. Now let's see how long
you last in a real fight.&quot; Your cover is blown and you must meet him in combat. Cross off a blow dart and

The afternoon sun is still shining down hard, and you feel exhausted from the running. You stop after
some time, hoping that you are well out of the Grass Mutant's territory. You reach a four-way junction in
the path. In the middle of the junction you spot the gruesome remains of a Forest Goblin. You can smell
decay in the air, and maggots crawl all over it. It must have died many days ago and you don't bother with
searching it. Will you go north (turn to 179), west (turn to 330), or east (turn to 307)?

You head up river in search of a ford, finding one after about a quarter of an hour. As you are making
your way across, voices call to you from further up river, and you turn to see two Dwarves in a rowing
boat. One of them shouts that they have lost an oar, and you see it floating towards you. You grab the oar
once it is within reach, and climb onto the bank to wait for the Dwarves to catch up.
&quot;Thank you, stranger,&quot; says the Dwarf who takes the oar from you, &quot;I'm afraid we can't repay your
kindness, unless a lift as far as Stonebridge would be of any help.&quot; You work out that accepting the lift
could cut a day or two off the time it would take you to get to Fang, and are also curious as to why these
Dwarves are heading for Stonebridge, so you accept. On the way you discover that they live there, but
have been away visiting distant relatives, and know nothing of the Dark Elf army that threatens Allansia,
so you explain something of the situation.
You are recognised upon your arrival in Stonebridge, and while disappointed to learn that you have not
yet completed your mission, the Dwarves of the village are still pleased to see you, and arrange a small
celebration to mark your return. You eat well that evening, and spend a comfortable night in the finest
guest room in the village (add 2 STAMINA points).
The following morning you are given two meals' worth of Provisions before you set off north to Fang. It
takes you two days to sight your destination, and for each of those days you must eat a meal. On the third
morning you get the ferry across the River Kok to Fang. It costs 2 Gold Pieces, or you can go for free if
you row the boat yourself, in which case the effort will so tire you that you must deduct 1 from your
Attack Strength in the next two fights you get into. Whether you pay or work your way across, you may
now enter Fang. Turn to 131.

You must hurry. Light is fading fast and that'll make things all the more difficult. You ask one of the
locals the whereabouts of Darkside Pier.
&quot;Darkside Pier?&quot; the man quizzes. &quot;Oh, you must mean 'Dockside' Pier. It's by the river just past Horse
Market district. That way.&quot;
When you arrive, there is no one present at the pier. It appears that the town is settling down for the night.
All of the streets have darkened and become ghostly. The winds have picked up and the snow is still

Thinking quickly, you place the statuette on the floor and speak the magic words. Everyone backs away
in fright as a great Black Panther is summoned. At your command, it bounds forward searching for the
dark elf in the room. Within seconds it finds its prey. You sense that the lieutenant is no match against the
ferocity of the Black Panther, and moments later, this is proven when his torn and bloody corpse
reappears. As thought: while normal eyes are unable to pierce the illusion of invisibility, the eyes of a
magical creature are able to perceive such things through magical vision. Job done, the Panther vanishes.
Cross the statuette off your Adventure Sheet.
As the court settles down, the king thanks Sir Rowan for his salvation. The knight bows and returns your
weapon to you, patting you on the shoulder. &quot;Nice cat; an unusual but effective solution. I believe this is
what you require, warrior.&quot; He gives you an item found on Delgar's body. It is one of the tooth-pieces you

You ask if you can join the couple and they are more than happy for the company. The man introduces
himself as Kalden, a miner; the woman is his wife Juria, a jeweller. They ask about your business in
Warpstone and you explain that you are interested in learning more about the mines.
&quot;Then you've come to the right person,&quot; says Kalden, &quot;Were mining gold, silver and gems from very deep
in the mountains. The mines and the city of Warpstone are over 150 years old and thus our mines are a
myriad of tunnels that you could get lost in for weeks if you don't know where to go. We have a huge map
of the tunnels but it is so huge that no one can carry it anymore.&quot; Kalden lets out a small laugh, and you
try to imagine how big the map is. &quot;We of course only enter the tunnels where we are currently mining, so
we have a pretty good idea of how to get in and out. Since our tunnels are very deep, it would take forever
to get the ore and gems out of the mines by simply carrying it, not to mention how backbreaking it is so
we have carts to move the ore through the tunnels. To make it easier, we have placed metal tracks beneath
the wheels to better push the carts along. That has made our mining operation a lot faster and easier, but
when it comes to mining the ore itself nothing beats a little manual labour, and we are happy to do it.
Sometimes it's also nice to walk in the marketplace and see all the things for sale and say to oneself that,
I'm the one who mined that.&quot;
Juria snickers and says, &quot;And sometimes saying it to oneself doesn't seem enough. You should hear him
in the store sometimes, picking up a jewel and making jokes that he remembers mining that particular
gem.&quot;
Kalden smiles sheepishly and continues, &quot;The only problem with having such large interconnecting
tunnels is the inevitable creatures of the wild that set up lairs in some of our abandoned tunnels. We try to
seal off most of our useless tunnels but sometimes the creatures do get through, so we have soldiers
standing guard to protect us from these beasts. The upside of it is that it does attract adventurers who seek
fame and fortune trying to dispatch of these creatures. There are a few old entrances in the mountains that
no longer lead to the mines, but are host to a lot of different creatures.&quot;

excuses and bid them farewell. Turn to 261.

You head towards the commotion. The air is filled with dust, reducing your visibility and making you
cough. You can dimly see where part of one building has collapsed into the ground. There is a hole, a
crater, in the ground ahead. The slope of the crater is covered with the stone and wood remains of at least
a couple of more buildings. It would be very dangerous to try and climb down into the crater - the rubble
shifts and collapses further downwards as you watch.
It is strangely silent. Distantly you can hear muted screams and the sound of fighting. Moving around the
edge of the crater, you spot the first body, gruesomely hacked apart. Moving closer, you see several other
brutally damaged bodies. You can hear the footsteps of someone coming towards you. Out of the dust
ahead strides an ancient skeletal figure holding an antique sword. The sword and skeleton are both
covered with fresh blood and other, even worse, remains. You only just have time to raise your weapon

Under a veil of invisibility, you advance confidently towards the Dark Elf. Sure enough, he cannot see
you, but is by no means unaware of your presence. He cocks his head from left to right trying to pinpoint
your location. That something is out there, he has no doubt; but you have the advantage. You edge
towards him stealthily, ever closer...closer...then strike! The lieutenant's blade flashes - a speed even you
find astonishing - half-parrying what would have been a fatal blow. He takes the wound instead in his
shoulder causing him to lose grip on a serrated knife. Stifling a cry of pain, he slashes his sword about
wildly, trying to track you by your footprints in the snow. You rush in to finish him off.

Helmund criticizes your every finding but you retaliate with some sensible reasoning to back your claims.
Soon you begin to win favour of the court that grows increasingly suspicious of their grand counsellor.
&quot;The court has seen, and it has heard,&quot; the king announces. &quot;The adventurer has reason to suspect Grand
Counsellor Helmund for villainous deeds. It is therefore, with regret, necessary to have his person and his
quarters investigated.&quot; Soldiers begin to advance on him, their hands ready on their weapons. Helmund
protests but the king adds that he needn't worry if he is innocent. The villain is about to make another
speech when his outline begins to glow. At this, he loses his nerve. Before anyone can stop him, he twists
a jewelled ring and vanishes to everyone's amazement! You draw your weapon and scan the room for the
lieutenant.
&quot;Over here,&quot; a voice whispers. A hush descends and all eyes turn to the throne. The lieutenant has
reverted back to his Dark Elf guise with the effects of a doppelganger potion wearing off. He has a dagger
to the king's throat and no one dares move a muscle. &quot;One trick you never learned about, adventurer,&quot; the
Dark Elf smirks. &quot;I call it a disappearing act.&quot;
Bewildered, the king enquires, &quot;Helmund, just what do you-&quot;
&quot;Actually, the name's Delgar, your lordship, of the Elanchaeanath clan. Helmund died weeks ago after
meeting an unfortunate incident. I have assumed his identity since with the good commander's help. Loth
was merely a pawn, greedy and blind enough to believe in glory out of treason. Which brings me to you,
your lordship. You and your underlings foolish enough to fall into our trap. Please forgive us, but your
city was too great a threat to dismiss, so I had to make a few changes. I hope you like it. After all, it was
your command that allowed things to happen. Where are your troops, your lordship? Where are your
champions?&quot;
Salamon is growing tired of the Dark Elf's mockery. &quot;Get to the point, dark one. What is it you want?&quot;
Delgar laughs, &quot;What I want, I already have: the armies of Salamonis riding many leagues to nowhere;
the royal court falling into discord; and now, the king himself at my mercy. If the snivelling adventurer
hadn't discovered my true identity, things would have been progressing smoothly. But since you asked, I
do have one small request. Rise, your lordship, and reveal the 'secret' passage. We are taking a trip away
from this miserable place.&quot;
The king is dragged from the throne, still with the dagger to his throat, and made to activate a switch you
thought only to be a part of the back wall. You watch as a section of the wall begins to rise slowly. The
situation is getting desperate as the Dark Elf prepares to escape with King Salamon as hostage. For a
second, Delgar looks over his shoulder wary of foul play and you rush forwards. But a threatening stare
from the lieutenant stops you in your tracks.
&quot;No adventurer, I did not ask you to follow. Why don't you wait here obediently like the rest of your kind.
Word of your king will reach you in a few days' time if my path is unobstructed.&quot;
The lieutenant shuffles towards the opening, and suddenly you spot it. Playing along, you shout words of
abuse at him, cursing him for a coward, and that you will thwart his evil schemes all the same. Delgar
laughs at your poor attempt to provoke him, but then senses something out of place. The wall section has
opened fully but instead of a secret passage, it is just another chamber. An armoured knight stands there;
visor down, sword poised to strike. Caught off guard and fearful for his own life, the Dark Elf turns to
parry with his dagger and Salamon is able to break free. As the king makes a dash for safety, you throw
your weapon at the lieutenant with all your might.
Test your Skill. If you use a dagger or the Sword of Tamahelos, deduct 1 point from the dice roll. If the
result is equal to or less than your score, turn to 192. If it is greater, turn to 208.

To your left loom the Moonstone Hills, another notoriously dangerous part of Allansia, and you remain
alert to the possibility of another ambush as you continue on your way. Your caution proves unnecessary,
though, as the only living thing that comes anywhere near you during your journey is a small flock of
birds passing overhead. Early in the afternoon you happen upon a dusty track leading in more or less the
right direction, and decide to follow it. Towards dusk the trail leads you to a small farming village. You
see an old man sitting outside a weathered shack, and ask him where you are. He tells you that the name
of the place is Coven, and gives you directions to the local tavern, where you can get a hot meal and a
room for the night for three Gold Pieces. Make a note on your Adventure Sheet that you have been to
Coven.
If you want to head towards the tavern and can afford the asking price, turn to 177. If you would rather
save your money, you leave Coven and continue on your way, making camp before nightfall. You must
eat a meal. You resume your journey in the morning (turn to 301).

You creep around the warehouses to investigate and see a pitch battle occurring between a large group of
thieves and rogues fighting against what look to be Pirate Zombies. Behind the Pirate Zombies but close
to you is their controller - a dark, savage looking man waving an Eldritch Rod, which burns with dark
energies. He has his back towards you.
As you take in the scene, several of the thieves fall in combat, only to be animated as Zombies themselves
to turn on their companions. It is obvious the battle is turning against the rogues. Needing information,
your course of action is clear. You leap forward and strike the Zombie Master a terrible blow from behind,
spinning him around. Despite his wound he glares at you with sunken eyes and spits curses at you as he
defends himself with the power from within the Eldritch Rod. You must fight.

ZOMBIE MASTER (wounded)                     SKILL 9           STAMINA 4

If the Zombie Master ever wins an Attack Round, you not only take the normal amount of STAMINA
damage but you are also struck by dark energies. You can choose to Test your Luck to avoid the power of
this evil magic. If you are successful, you suffer no further ill effects. If you are unsuccessful or if you
decide not to Test your Luck, the necromantic energies eat into your body, causing you to lose 1 SKILL
point. If you win the battle, turn to 87.

The thieves look at each other and sinister grins start appearing on their faces.
&quot;Guess you are going to have to pay a forfeit,&quot; says one.
You hear the metallic sound of several daggers being drawn from their sheaths. You must run!
You dash away from The Noose, chased by a pack of bloodthirsty thieves. They shout and hoot at one
another, calling out your location so you cannot escape them. You flee under the darkening skies. Your
only hope is to reach a town gate before you are surrounded and cut down. Turn to 254.

A bell rings noisily. Wixil manages to kick you away and the bell rings again as he frantically yanks on
the rope. The door opens inviting in three hefty guards. There is still a chance for you to escape, but you
must Test your Skill followed by your Luck. You spot a back door, and these men are ready to chase and
vault over furniture to get at you.
If you succeed in both rolls, you rush out of the shop running as far as you can until you cannot run any
more. Turn to 284.
If you failed either roll, you are seized by the arms and dragged out of the store. You can hear the Gnome
yelling out after you, &quot;I will be betting against you in the arena! You messed with the wrong shop!&quot; Your

You flow through the crowded streets towards the centre of town. Up ahead you hear music playing and
see a large group of townsfolk drinking and dancing. In front of you a large, savage looking man clutches
at his belt, bellowing out &quot;Thief! Thief!&quot; as a smaller man dashes away through the throng towards a

You ask the old man why he is walking in a dangerous forest completely defenceless. He laughs at your
question. &quot;I am a priest, and we priests don't fear death,&quot; he says boldly. He tells you that he is going for a
quick stroll through the forest. You ask the priest if he knows anything about the Dark Elves in the area.
He shows surprise on his face at the mentioning of Dark Elves.
&quot;Those unholy disciples of evil do not deserve to exist. Why are you so interested in them?&quot; He is getting
uneasy with the new subject. You tell him that you and Yaztromo are determined to stop the plans of a
powerful Dark Elf army. His attitude changes completely with the mentioning of Yaztromo. He looks at
you with awe and says, &quot;They have an army now? A Dark Elf army is never good. I must help you with

As you near the bottom of the crater, you notice a narrow hole into the rubble. There are signs that
something has recently come out. You crawl in to investigate.
It is a squeeze at first but then the tunnel opens out. You can hear the mass of stone and wood above you
shifting and groaning under its own weight. You cannot see much but notice light in one direction shining
dimly through the dust. Cautiously you head that way and start to make out a few details.
There is a wall to one side of you where the stone has been worked to show pictures - battle scenes.
Ahead of you is a carven pillar, slightly askew now with the weight of the rubble upon it. Suddenly you
realise what has happened - this must be some sort of underground complex. Something, or someone, has
knocked out a number of the supports. The weight from above must have been too much and several
houses have collapsed into the complex.
You move past another support pillar and see the source of the light. An altar in the room ahead is
glowing, pulsing, with a sickly red light. Near the altar are several destroyed Skeleton Warriors and
around them are the bodies of a number of Sewer Goblins. One side of the room has collapsed and you
can see the bodies of several more Goblins crushed beneath.
Before the altar is a large, horribly mutated Sewer Goblin, its large spiked tail whipping from side to side
in agitation. It lifts something from the altar and up on to its head: a strange, near-transparent helmet. You
can see a passage carved into the rock on the far side leading out of the crater. To get there, you will have
to deal with the Goblin. Wary of its tail, if you have any, you may use Antitoxin before battle begins. It
turns at the sound of your footsteps and leaps forward to engage you with a fury that momentarily stops
you in your tracks. This will be no easy fight.

MUTANT SEWER GOBLIN                        SKILL 6          STAMINA 9

At the end of each Attack Round roll one die. On a roll of 1-2, the Mutant's tail strikes you solidly,
injecting you with poison. Lose 1 STAMINA from the tail strike and a further 2 STAMINA from the
poison. On a roll of 3-6, the tail misses.
Additionally, if you ever win an Attack Round against the Mutant Sewer Goblin and your current SKILL
is greater than the Mutant Sewer Goblin's SKILL, then the helmet the Mutant is wearing emits a dull glow.
This causes him to redouble his attacks, adding 1 to his SKILL for the rest of the battle and will happen
every time you wound him, so long as your SKILL remains higher than his SKILL.
If you manage to slay the foul creature, turn to 132.

The trek south towards Port Blacksand is uneventful. Over the course of the day you encounter a couple
of traders heading the other way, but neither of them has anything likely to be of use to you. Early in the

Hurriedly, you grab the vial and empty its contents. The poison is being neutralised and the innkeeper
shrieks as you get back on to your feet. You expect an easy fight...until he begins to change: matte, black
hair sprouts all over his body; sharp claws extend from his fingertips; and his face elongates, developing
rat-like features. No longer a puny old man, the bloodthirsty Wererat leaps to attack.

WERERAT                                    SKILL 8          STAMINA 6

The lieutenant is dead along with her disciples. A quick search produces various items tainted by chaos
which you stay well away from. But your heart leaps on discovering one of the tooth-pieces you are after.
This one is engraved with five intricate runes and you happily place it in your pocket. You congratulate
the workers who have triumphed in their battle against their former captors and lead them outside. You
collect your backpack and other possessions along the way. (Any poisoned weapons you have yet to use
will still inflict 3 STAMINA points of damage for the next combat you use it in. Thereafter, the poison
will have evaporated reducing damage to the normal 2 points per strike.) The freed slaves shield their
eyes against the sun but are overjoyed to see daylight after such long confinement. With an ecstatic cheer,
they hail you as their hero. If only Tareg could see you now. A lowly caravan guard you certainly are not.
Add 1 to your Initial LUCK score and raise your current LUCK to this new value. The workers plead for
you to stay and celebrate with them but you explain that every moment is vital to your quest and must
continue as soon as possible.
&quot;Then take us with you. We are all willing to follow in your footsteps,&quot; a young man announces, and the
others nod in agreement. But one look at their battered forms concludes your verdict.
&quot;No, I shall go alone. You are no longer slaves. You have endured much hardship and witnessed enough
bloodshed to last a lifetime. Enjoy your freedom now that you have it. Use the gold to regain your lives.&quot;
The workers look disappointed though they know you are right. They insist that you at least take a few
items to aid you on your quest. A Dwarf emerges from the mine bearing gifts. You accept a couple of
gold nuggets worth 4 Gold Pieces each, an iron helmet, a rope and grappling hook, and an unusual
artefact. It resembles a club, of sorts, fashioned in the shape of a wingless, serpentine dragon with jaws
clamped around a polished orb.
&quot;We discovered this weeks ago during one of our digs, keeping it well hidden from the Dark Elves,&quot;
Damon explains. &quot;The Dwarfs recognise it as the Dragonstone Sceptre used by a great Dwarven king
aeons ago. Legend has it that there is no material it cannot shatter though only a true hero can wield it.
Take it with our blessing.&quot;
Add the magic sceptre to your possessions - it counts as a blunt weapon. Being large and unwieldy, it
reduces your Attack Strength by 2 should you use it in combat. Any damage you inflict is increased to 4
(6 if you successfully Test for Luck, 2 if you fail). Delivering a blow with such a mighty weapon will
require all the strength you can muster.

You climb down into the darkened hold, the lantern illuminating only a couple of metres around you. It is
enough light to reveal a mound of grey sacks over to one side, and you decide to start by checking them.
As you move closer, though, you realise that these are not sacks at all. Their shape and size is closer to
that of people, and the outer wrapping is not sackcloth but silken fibre. Could a Giant Spider have wiped
out the entire crew of this barge?
Suddenly afraid for your life, you spin round, raising the lantern high to see if you can spot any sign of
the creature clinging to the roof of the hold above you, or descending towards you on a thread. You see
only shadows, but hear... a hissing? That sounds more like a snake than a spider. Maybe more than one
snake. Just how many creatures are there down here?
At the edge of the pool of light cast by the lantern, a little way above the floor, something gleams. Some
things - two, three, four... A cluster of eyes reflecting the lamplight. And then the abomination that has
killed the whole crew of this barge half-scuttles, half-slithers forward. So horrific is the sight that
confronts you, you drop the lantern.
If you have another light source, turn to 270 at once. Otherwise, Test your Luck. If you are Lucky, the
lantern remains alight, so you can see to defend yourself against the creature (turn to 270). If you are
Unlucky, the light goes out, and you die in terror and darkness.

A flight of steps leads you into a gloomy area, the narrow street overshadowed by run-down buildings,
with only the occasional narrow alley dividing any of them. To your left is a dead end, a large dilapidated
house blocking the way, but on your right the street runs a short distance before curving to the left. As
you follow it round, a tall man in tattered clothing emerges from a low gate and blocks your way.
&quot;You are brave adventurer, to come into the Noose. Either brave, or a fool!&quot;
Other thieves slide out from the shadows to surround you. They look tense but are not actively
hostile...yet. You explain your situation to the men.
&quot;Interesting,&quot; the man ahead of you says, &quot;But before we can help you, we need payment. There is a toll
for entering our territory. Let's see what you have.&quot;
If you want to offer the thieves coins, it will take no less than 5 Gold Pieces for them to let you pass. If

You start by heading for the nearby bridge across the Red River. As you approach the bridge, you see a
barge heading down river towards it. Aware that time is of the essence, you call out to the barge pilot,
asking if he's going to Blacksand.
&quot;What, and get my throat cut?&quot; he yells back. &quot;No, we're bound for Kaad.&quot;
Checking your map, you find that Kaad is a long way to the west. It's some distance north of Blacksand,
but you reckon that if you can get a lift on the barge, you could save two days' travel time. After a little
haggling, you manage to arrange transportation to the Kaad tributary. Deduct 2 Gold pieces. The pilot
brings the barge close enough to the river's edge that you can jump aboard.
During the journey you chat with the crew, but learn nothing that's likely to be of any use to you in your
quest. The sun is low in the sky by the time you leap ashore and bid farewell to the bargemen, so you only
travel a short distance further before making camp for the night. You must eat a meal.

As the creature's gaze begins to affect you, your grip on the hide weakens. It slips from your fingers,
falling back down to conceal the cage's occupant. With eye contact broken, you return to your senses and
hurriedly back away from the cage. You almost fell victim to a deadly Mesmero Lizard - an eerie cousin
to the more common Basilisk.
You continue along a narrow aisle that presumably leads to an exit. Many of the cages are covered and
come in various sizes.
If you know of a specific cage number and want to visit that cage, turn to that number now.
If not, you walk round a bend into another cage-filled corridor causing monsters and wild animals to snarl
and growl as you pass by. The racket is bound to grab someone's attention. Indeed, you are soon stopped
by a group of wandering guards.
&quot;Hey! What business have you down here? Spectators are restricted from this area.&quot;
You tell them you are lost.
&quot;Lost are you?&quot; the leader sneers. &quot;Guess we should show you the way out then.&quot; He nods and you are

Startled into action by your command, the men charge forwards, holding up the dead bodies. Regardless
of their comrades, the Dark Elves let fly their missiles. To your horror, the arrows, powered by foul
sorcerous arts, penetrate through corpse and man alike. The men fall to such deadly assault, and still the
flight of the arrows continue, wounding several more. Roll one die. If you roll 1-3, you are struck by an
arrow - lose 3 STAMINA points. If you roll 4 or more, you avoid injury. In desperation, the workers force
the cart off the tracks sending it thundering into the enemy. Those knocked aside present easy targets for
your pick axe. The guards are in panic and confusion, fumbling for their hand-to-hand weapons as the
slaves rush into them screaming battle cries - burning desires for revenge against their captors becoming
their greatest strength.
&quot;Go now, my friend,&quot; says Damon, &quot;Before that witch calls on reinforcements. We'll take care of the
guards.&quot; You discard your pick axe for a poison-coated scimitar. It inflicts the same amount of damage as
the dagger you have though you need not make any deductions to your Attack Strength when using it.

After a long while you decide that this kind of blind searching is futile and decide to exit the mines.
Unfortunately, you have no idea where you are, or where the exit is, so you once again wander aimlessly

The thieves' destination is a row of decrepit warehouses by the water. A small ring of thuggish looking
men are surrounded and battling for their lives against a larger group of figures - figures dressed as pirates

The master thief is glad to have the boots back, explaining that he once lost them in a contest. You head
back into The Noose and back to the thieves' guild. You sit comfortably, sipping a glass of fine wine,
while the master thief relates what he knows. Restore 2 STAMINA points.
Disappointingly, the thieves of Port Blacksand have not noticed any Dark Elf activity within their city and
the master thief proclaims boldly that if they don't know about any activity, then there is none. He can
give you one lead however. He explains that they are in contact with a guild much like their own in
Salamonis (except smaller and poorly run, he mutters). That guild has reported some &quot;unusual&quot; decisions
being made at the highest level in the city as well as a determined effort to cause unrest amongst the
common people by person or persons unknown. &quot;It could be one of your Dark Elf lieutenants causing
trouble.&quot; Restore 1 LUCK point if you have not yet been to Salamonis.
&quot;Now, normally we would have to kill you for entering The Noose,&quot; he chuckles at your expression, &quot;but
since you have done us not one, but two favours this evening, I think it's only fair we repay you properly.&quot;
You are presented with a package containing 2 Provisions for your journey as well as a choice of potions:
one of Skill, Stamina, or Luck. Whichever you choose will restore the relevant Attribute to its Initial level.
You may drink it at any time except during combat.

You carefully move into the room, closing the door all but a fraction behind you so as to remain unseen.
You start to search the room and become certain that this must be the quarters of one of the Dark Elf
lieutenants.
A cursory search of the room turns up nothing of value but looking at the bed you notice something
strange. One of the bedposts has a slightly worn mark in a circle near the top as if...you place your hand
on the top of the bedpost and carefully twist. It turns around and then releases. Lifting it up you find a
small secret compartment carved into the bedpost. Within is a ring made from silver and twisted around
itself to signify the Chaos symbol. If you wish to take this Chaos Marked Ring, decide if you are going to
wear it or place it in your pocket.
Seeing nothing else of value in the room, you head back to the door and assess your options. To your
right are the slave quarters. If you possess a Potion of Invisibility and wish to drink it before dashing

The waiting crowds soon disperse but you stay loitering outside the arena shivering from the chill of
snowfall. Thinking this is a bad idea, you figure that you might as well look for an alternative way of
getting into this structure. While skirting around it, a faint echo of a growl nearby comes to your attention.
Searching through a pile of bric-a-brac and ruined timbers, you uncover a small tunnel dark and dingy. It
must lead to the levels below the arena where beasts are kept. Entering could prove very treacherous but it

You come into an open grassy meadow and ahead the trees thin out. The afternoon sun shines down
intensely, and you soon find walking becoming a chore. In the distance, you can see low rising hills. You
walk onwards, alert for anything that could ambush an adventurer like you. Without warning, the ground
shakes as a large humanoid makes its way towards you. In fact, it is much larger than an average human
is! You prepare for battle against the brute as it casually pushes aside the trees in its path. The Giant
bellows and raises a club, ready to crush you.

evidence suggesting you may be an accomplice or any villain. You smile. Now it is your turn. You show
the court your discoveries and explain where you found them - but will they be enough?

At your words, Helmund's face momentarily distorts with anger, and possibly just a hint of fear. His
momentary loss of self-control emboldens you, and you state your conviction that he is working against
the best interests of Salamonis.
&quot;Outrageous!&quot; Helmund snaps. He can hardly contain his rage but quickly checks himself. He continues
on a more collected level. &quot;Do not believe in such ludicrous falsehoods, your lordship. How dare this
upstart make these allegations before the royal court? Does one think that by rooting out a traitor, one is
free to accuse others of trickery? Perhaps a dungeon cell will teach the whelp some manners.&quot;
To you, that reaction says it all - Helmund must be the lieutenant in some form of disguise. He is feigning
innocence and trying to worm his way out of the situation. But around you, the courtiers murmur their
approval to Helmund's suggestion. Your outburst is clearly not sitting well with the crowd.
King Salamon raises a hand, silencing the court. &quot;If there is any truth to the adventurer's words, the matter
must be dealt with sensibly. Let anger not cloud our better judgment. The adventurer has done city and
court a great service this day; a dank dungeon cell will hardly be fitting for such a spirited character for a
simple slip of the tongue. It is said that reason exists behind every course of action and I, for one, believe
there is reason for the adventurer's rashness. Brave warrior, you have faced many ordeals on your long
journey here and must be battle-weary. Do you have evidence to back your claims or could this all just be
a misunderstanding?&quot;
A few of the courtiers can be seen nodding to their lord's fine oratory. Others are waiting attentively for
your response. But the king has acted wisely. Instead of having you arrested for causing disruption in the
royal court, he has given you a chance to prove yourself or drop the case altogether. How will you
answer?

&quot;My humblest apologies, your lordship, I must be mistaken.&quot; (Turn to 172.)
&quot;Evidence is what I have, your lordship, if you will permit me to express them.&quot; (Turn to 136.)

Cutting down the zombie, you look around at the raging battle. Several other zombies have been cut down
but a number of the thieves have also been slain. Worse still, as you watch, the dead thieves rise from the
ground and attack their former comrades, animated by the necromantic energies of the Zombie Master.
The battle is turning against you.
Spotting a momentary clear path between you and the Zombie Master, you leap towards him. He sees you
coming and raises his Eldritch Rod to defend himself. You must fight.

damage but you are also struck by dark energies. You can choose to Test your Luck to avoid the power of

and roll for combat normally. Against the other, you will also roll for your Attack Strengths, but you will
not damage it if you win - count it as if you have successfully blocked its attack. However it will still do

Captain Tully's men soon have the barge safely moored at the river's edge, and return to the Sea Horse so
it can resume its eastward journey. You encounter little traffic on the river during what remains of the day,
and as night draws in, you join the crew for a basic but filling meal. Conversation is dominated by the fate
of the men from the barge, and again you sleep poorly (add 1 STAMINA point for what rest you do get).
The following morning the ship comes into sight of Fang, and you see that the river is a lot more crowded
up ahead.
If you wish to go to Fang, this is not a problem, and Captain Tully drops you off outside the town (turn to

&quot;I know all the hidden places,&quot; he softly exclaims.
You decide to trust the boy and give him the name of your destination. He nods and immediately starts
leading you through the back ways and alleyways of Port Blacksand. While your first though is he might
be leading you into a trap, you quickly realise (as he cuts through the kitchen of an inn) that he is taken
you a roundabout way that avoids the worst of the dangers the city has to offer. Finally he stops and

As you put on the dead man's clothes you notice something in his pocket. It is a key, and judging from the
marks of manacles on his legs, it is apparently the guard's key. Unfortunately, if you are going to appear
like a slave, you must leave your backpack and most of your equipment here. You are able to conceal any


three items on your person. These may be potions, jewels, portions of Provisions and the like (rings and
keys are small enough to be overlooked), but not armour or weapons as these will give you away.
However, you pick up the dagger that the slave was carrying. While you use it you must deduct 1 from
your Attack Strength, but due to the poison on the blade you cause 3 STAMINA points of damage when
you hit your opponent. You also take the pick axe which will make you look a little more like a worker.
When you are ready, you move outside and climb down the rock face stealthily. You notice some of the
workers are driving carts away from the work area, and surmise that that may be the best place to join
them without being seen by the guards. As the workers halt to unload the dirt and rock from the cart, you
slip round a big rock and begin helping them. They look at you with astonishment and as you are
unloading, one of them whispers to you.
&quot;What are you doing here? Can't you see we're being held here against our wishes.&quot;
You whisper back that you are here to deal with the guards but cannot do it alone.
&quot;Well we can't help. We're manacled and can't move fast, and they have their bows. They'd kill us all.&quot;
You tell the man that you have a key that could free all the slaves here. You move over to the side of the
cart where the guards can't see you and produce the key from your pocket. For the first time you see a
spark of hope in the man's eyes.
&quot;But won't the guards notice the missing manacles before we're all freed.&quot;
You look over at the workers digging in the field. They are more or less standing in the same place all the
time and if their manacles were opened but not removed, the guards might not see. You explain this to the
man, and he almost smiles.
&quot;Then we should be the last ones released as we have to move back and forth all the time. But since we
have to pick up loose rocks and dirt, we can get to the manacles without the guards noticing.&quot;
The man is anxious now and you gesture for him to calm down. &quot;Give me the key and I'll free the other
prisoners and explain what we must do. What exactly is the plan?&quot;
You explain that the workers far outnumber the guards. All you need is for them to overwhelm the guards
and steal their weapons. You ask the man if the Dark Elves have a leader, and he points over to a woman
standing on a tall rock face looking over the entire area. That must be their lieutenant. You tell him that
you will take care of her as long as he and his friends take care of the guards. He agrees and by this time
the cart is empty and you move back to the workers to fill it up again. As you pick up dirt and debris from
the ground you try not to look at the man, whose name you learned is Damon, since you do not wish to
risk the guards noticing what he is doing. When the cart is almost full, you ask him quietly how he is
progressing. He explains that everyone has agreed to help. The only people still in manacles are the ones
pushing the cart.
Suddenly another worker, a Dwarf, pushes the cart and some of its contents spill out on the ground. The
guards begin looking in your direction and a few make their way past the workers towards you. You start
looking like you are picking up the rubble while unlocking the remaining manacles. Turn to 7.

The city opens out into the Market Square. Shops line the square, which is crowded with stalls and
townsfolk busy haggling and trading. There is a small open area on the far side of the square, and you
make your way over to try and catch your bearings. In the centre of the open area is a statue of a warrior.
The warrior is standing with his sword raised above the cowering form of some sort of demonic creature.
Both statues look fairly new, but apart from the pigeons that are sitting on it, enjoying their new perch, the

With the Zombie Master slain, the remaining Zombies lose their focus and start to mill around aimlessly.
The blades of the thieves soon cut them down.
As the thieves start looting the bodies you find out more about the attack. A small group of the thieves
had smuggled in some &quot;special supplies&quot; for the festivities, knowing the guards at the gate would take
more than their fair share. As they docked and started to unload, another ship, a known pirate ship, pulled
up beside theirs and the Pirate Zombies boiled out from the hull.
&quot;I recognise the ship, it's the Bountiful Harvest,&quot; states one of the thieves. &quot;If this scum,&quot; he says kicking
the head of the Zombie Master, &quot;had of survived the battle, Azzur would have got him anyways. The
Bountiful Harvest's crew were close allies of Azzur, especially their captain. The necromancer must have
killed them while they were sleeping off their celebrations, then brought them back for the attack. But
how did he know about the goods?&quot;
One of the thieves tries picking up the Eldritch Rod and quickly draws away his now withered hand with
stream of curses as the energy from within the Rod is discharged into his body. The energies surrounding
the rod dim then stop. It is either completely drained or else dormant. None of the other thieves wish to
take the Eldritch Rod so you can carefully tuck it away in your backpack if you choose. Perhaps some
dark power can restore it. You are also presented with 8 Gold Pieces and a Jewelled Earring worth a
further 5 Gold Pieces as your share of the loot.
The leader of the band, a master thief, invites you back to The Noose. He intimates that he has some

A large crowd has gathered at the gates of Port Blacksand, the City of Thieves. There are numerous
guardsmen on the wall and you can even see a couple of foul-looking Trolls inspecting prospective
entrants before they are allowed inside. Ahead of you are a few gaudily painted wagons carrying
entertainers, jugglers, strongmen, clowns and the like towards the city.
Something out of the ordinary is occurring. You go over and ask one of the entertainers, a young women
looking after numerous monkeys, what is happening in the city?
&quot;It is the Reaver's Festival, commemorating one of Lord Azzur's most famous victories at sea. Three days
of celebration and entertainments. It doesn't happen on the same day every year however. Seems that
when the festival is held depends on the first storm of the season along with certain sacrifices Azzur
makes to his god.&quot; She looks troubled for a moment.
&quot;But what of yourself, adventurer? You have not come for the festival so must have another reason for
visiting Blacksand.&quot;
You decide it can't hurt to tell her a little of your quest and outline in general terms how you need to
locate the Dark Elf lieutenants.
&quot;I can't help you with that,&quot; she replies, &quot;but I may be able to help you get into the city. Without a pass
you will have to bribe your way in, even during the festival. You could travel with us and pretend to be
one of our band if you like.&quot;
They seem to be trustworthy people so you decide to go along with her plan. The entertainers hide you
amongst them, draping you with brightly coloured clothes so you blend in. It takes hours before you make
it to the head of the queue. You spend the time questioning the performers about themselves and about
Port Blacksand. Finally you get to the gates. A dull looking Troll gets given all the passes for the
entertainers. As the Troll tries to count the group, several of the acrobats flip back and forth in front of the
crowd. As it looks like the Troll is starting to make progress, another of the band moves forward and
starts spouting, in a strident voice, several lines from a famous play. The sun is heating up the day and the
Troll, after his fourth unsuccessful attempt to count you, wipes the sweat from his brow and waves you all

You have fought valiantly, but are aware that the rest of the Hobgoblin army is drawing ever closer, and
will soon overwhelm you. Suddenly a roar of voices sounds from behind the approaching horde, and the
sound of battle drifts towards you from the rear of the mob. The Hobgoblins' charge falters as they realise
they are being attacked from behind. A loud horn sounds from the midst of the Hobgoblin army to signal
a retreat, and all survivors turn and flee.
You have to catch your breath after the fight, and the next thing you know, you are surrounded by men in
armour. Their leader, a tall man with a red cape and a battered iron helmet, glowers down at you. &quot;You

If you have a scroll bearing the seal of King Salamon, turn to 278 at once.
If not, you explain a little about your quest, and the man concedes that you do have a good reason for
being here. He introduces himself as Captain Ritter, head of a band of troops sent out from Salamonis to
deal with an army of evil creatures reported to be amassing somewhere in the pass. From his description,
this army must be a separate one from the Dark Elf forces you are seeking to thwart, and it's a good deal
larger and more dangerous than the Hobgoblin troops you just encountered.
The Captain invites you to rest with the soldiers, as you'll be safer in their company, and you agree. A
soldier with a curved scar on his chin is called to stand guard as you settle down.
You must eat a meal before you rest as the soldiers are conserving their supplies. Still, in the midst of the
Salamonis army you do have a safe night's sleep, and may restore 2 STAMINA points.
As the troops have not yet found the hostile army they seek, the Captain decides to sweep east through the
pass in search of the enemy forces the following day, so you have a large military escort as you continue
towards your objective, and are not troubled by any attackers for the rest of your journey through
Trolltooth Pass. At the mouth of the pass you bid farewell to the Captain and his army, and head south

in Allansia, will be the first to fall and you will join in its destruction.&quot; You must fight.

COMMANDER LOTH                              SKILL 9            STAMINA 8

The armour he wears is of a strange design and reduces any damage you inflict by one point. However, a
blow from his mighty mace inflicts 3 points of damage to your STAMINA each time it hits you. If you
win, turn to 252.

Crack! A blinding pain shoots through your head as you are stuck from behind. If you are wearing a
helmet, subtract 2 STAMINA from the blow. If you have no helmet, the blow staggers you, sending you
against a wall and almost causing you to pass out, lose 1 SKILL point and 3 STAMINA points. If you are
still alive, you see a small, rat-featured man behind you, wielding a club. It is the original thief. He looks
past you to your other opponent, &quot;Caught ourselves an adventurer this time. Rich pickings!&quot;
The larger man presses the attack

BRIGAND                                     SKILL 7            STAMINA (As recorded)

Each Attack Round, you must also roll one die. On a 1-3, the smaller man has struck you a glancing blow
with his club and you must deduct a further 1 STAMINA point irrespective of whether you won or lost
the combat round. If you defeat the brigand, turn to 211.

Sweet aroma drifting from the incense envelops you making you feel drowsy for a moment. You have
been granted the blessing of Asrel: a single wound you sustain in battle will not scar your body. In effect,
you suffer no damage whatsoever from the attack. This special gift may be used only once at any time
during combat. You thank the goddess and reluctantly leave the peaceful sanctuary. Turn to 168.

Just as you reach for the door it flings outwards slamming into you. You are knocked on to your rear.
Three men and a woman who have caused you this anguish and embarrassment only repay you with
laughter.
&quot;Oh! The poor dear is bleeding! Why are you standing behind the door?&quot; hollers the woman and punches
one of the larger men in his fat gut for it. He flinches and takes no offence. &quot;Help that poor soul up!&quot;
The man lends you a hand pulling you off the ground with brute force. You can now feel the warm blood
she spoke of on your upper lip. You wipe it off and are startled at the pain in touching your nose in the
slightest. Lose 1 STAMINA point. &quot;Best go inside an' get some drink into you,&quot; says the man. In his eyes,
you can see he is not sincere, and really does not care if he accidentally smashed your nose in. He is only
showing himself off to the woman by helping you. When they leave, you are free to enter.
The dark tavern smells of stewing lentils and meat - a lucky perfume to drown the foul odours that would
normally consume a wretched place as this. You can make out five customers in the dim light. The
innkeeper has been watching you since you stepped in, and the look on his face is that of either disgust or
annoyance; you can't tell. He comes over to you grasping a dirty-looking cloth and, as if you were a child,
holds it firmly at your face. You shove him off, hearing a few soft chuckles in the room. After your nose
stops bleeding, you can buy a bowl of stew if you wish for 2 Gold Pieces - restore 4 STAMINA points.
There is a man and a woman at the furthest end of the room, but they look like they do not want to be
bothered by the looks they are giving you. Two men sitting at a table in the corner are playing a dice
game. To join them, turn to 347. If you walk over and sit with an elderly chap by the door, turn to 14. If
you prefer to leave and explore elsewhere, turn to 309.

Startled into action by your command, the Dwarfs rush forwards dextrously sending pick axes whirling at
the enemy. Most find their mark, impaling the guards squarely in the chest before they can dodge aside.
The Dwarfs certainly feel at home fighting in these enclosed spaces. Gain 1 LUCK point. The guards are
in panic and confusion, fumbling for their hand-to-hand weapons as the slaves rush into them screaming
battle cries - burning desires for revenge against their captors becoming their greatest strength. &quot;Go now,
my friend,&quot; says Damon, &quot;Before that witch calls on reinforcements. We'll take care of the guards.&quot; You
discard your pick axe for a poison-coated scimitar. It inflicts the same amount of damage as the dagger
you have though you need not make any deductions to your Attack Strength when using it. You veer
away from the battle felling another adversary in your way. Turn to 90.

The greens of its eyes swirl in rhythms becoming a collage of liquid metals; greens of gems and greens of
the land. It is fascinatingly beautiful. Why such a creature would be entered in the arena of death is no
doubt the intentions of a cruel heart. The people of Fang are no better. You feel sympathy for the reptile.
You reach out to touch it on a rippled cheek and it repays you by plopping out its massive tongue licking
your arm. Its eyes begin to solidify to a delicate black hue. You cannot stop watching it. It lumbers closer
towards you and bites off your arm. Then, it grabs your tunic with its claws pulling you to the bars. In
agony, you manage to smile at it. It's not its fault. It's only an animal after all. You reach out with your
other arm and it sinks its teeth into it tearing it off at the shoulder. Men arrive yelling desperately at you,
but you are enraptured by the beast. You feel hands grabbing at your legs, trying to yank you away from
the cage. One last look from the lizard gives you the indication that it is time to offer your head through
the bars. It is a game of tug-of-war between the monster's trainers and itself. In the end, the men pull back
a headless adventurer.
&quot;Throw the tarp back down!&quot; yells one of them, disgusted. &quot;Somebody fetch a mop and a wash-boy!&quot;

You cut down the thief and search his body, finding a further 3 Gold Pieces cunningly hidden in his
cloak's lining, which you can add to your adventure sheet. Leaving the bodies for the rats, you continue
onwards. But since you are unfamiliar with the city, you must roll one die to see where you end up. If the

confused and uncertain. Lose 2 LUCK points.
&quot;Good.&quot; he states. &quot;That will provide you with adequate protection.&quot;

You start to scale the building. It is surprisingly hard going. The house is old and worn; boards and tiles
crack and come loose under your weight. If you possess a Rope or are able to drink a Potion of Climbing,
you make it up and back down with the coat in no time, turn to 81.
Otherwise you struggle up as best you can. Test your Skill. If you are successful, you manage to get close
enough to grab the coat and make your way down to the waiting boy, turn to 81. If you are unsuccessful,
you slide off the roof as you get higher and come crashing down to the ground, right on top of a cart full
of manure, much to the merriment of the onlooking crowd. Although unhurt, you stink terribly, so you
decide to pay for a local washerwoman to take your fouled clothes and clean them, either cross 1 Gold
Piece or 1 Provision off your character sheet for these services (if you don't have any Gold Pieces or
Provisions she will clean your clothes for free out of a sense of charity). By the time she returns with the
slightly damp but much cleaner clothes, the boy is long gone. Turn to 197.

If you have now visited all five, or at least three, of the locations marked on the map and wish to end your
search, you may contact Yaztromo by turning to 383.
Otherwise, your first step on the next leg of your journey must be to head north from Salamonis across
the Windward Plain. For much of the morning the Craggen Heights block the sun from view, and a sharp
wind sweeps across the plain to further chill you. If you do not have a warm cloak, you must deduct 1
STAMINA point for the cold. Unless this leads to your death from exposure, you quicken your pace
onwards. If you are heading for Warpstone, turn to 301.
If not, after a while you bear north-west to avoid the dangers of Trolltooth Pass. For hours you see no
other signs of life, but late in the afternoon you find a weathered signpost bearing the name Coven, and by
early evening you have reached the village of that name. You have little trouble locating the local inn, but
it has a note nailed to its door, reading 'Closed on Family Buisness'.
A passing farmer says you can spend the night in his barn for 2 Gold Pieces, and he'll throw in a meal for
no extra charge. If you accept, you have an uncomfortable but quiet night, and may restore 2 STAMINA
points for the night's rest. Otherwise, you must camp outside the village and eat your own food, assuming
you have any left. Deduct one portion of Provisions. Make a note on your Adventure Sheet that you have
been to Coven.
You set off again the next day. If you are heading for Port Blacksand, turn to 130. If you continue north
towards Fang and Zengis, you keep clear of the nearby Forest of Spiders, and early in the afternoon you
cross a river and pass beyond the southernmost edge of the Moonstone Hills (turn to 237).

Before long you emerge from the forest and find yourself at the river's edge. Now you can properly see
the sky, it is not hard to work out where you are, and you feel confident that you should be able to
navigate through the forest to reach Salamonis with no further difficulties. As you are about to turn back

the riverbank. Your curiosity gets the better of you, and you move closer to investigate. Turn to 322.

Your triumph is short lived as a pulse of energy from the portal sends a wave of revitalising energy
through the creature. Worse still, more of the creature is continuously worming its way through the portal
and into the cavern.
You clutch at your head as you are suddenly assaulted by terrible visions: visions of the Chaos Incarnate
spreading across the land, driving Elves from their forests and overcoming ranks of Dwarves that bitterly
fight to defend their ancestral underground homes. You see women and children fleeing from towns with
only the possessions they can carry. You see Salamonis, its walls lined with knights and wizards ready to
defend their city, only to be thrown into disarray as the creature spreads its tendrils and overwhelms the
city. There is one final vision even more terrifying than the rest. It is of the whole continent of Allansia,
covered from end to end by a writhing mass of chaos, all other creatures long since driven away or
incorporated into its mass, and yet, even then it is extending its form further, into the surrounding seas
and outwards...
You force the vision away with a wrench. In front of you is the creature, almost fully restored of the
damage you have done and growing steadily larger, more powerful. You cannot defeat this foe by force of
arms. Your only chance is to destroy the Chaos Gate.

For a while the beast thrashes about and then quietens, but you have lost track of where it is. Cautiously
you peer through...and nearly have your face ripped off by a talon! You wait a few more moments until
you hear a groan and a thump; the poison must have taken effect. Climbing in, you see that the beast is
merely unconscious. You don't get a good look at it because the sound of approaching voices forces you
to extinguish your light and keep still in the near darkness. Without warning, the cage judders and slides
noisily - someone is pulling it. Beasts in the other cages bark and snarl their irritation. The cage soon
comes to a halt and the voices fade round the corner leaving the room deathly silent.
If you have a Gantamaran Calf following, turn to 339 immediately.
If not, you lift up a piece of hide covering the cage and slip out through the bars, taking a look at what
you were hitching a ride with: a large reptilian with a short frill and a row of spikes along its back.

The man is swept away before you can learn more. Finally you break free of the revellers and take shelter

You sit down to catch your breath after the fight, and then give the body a quick examination to see if
there are any spoils of victory for you to claim. The Troll appears to have fallen on hard times since you
last fought him, and the only item of any likely use that you can find is its Warhammer. You may take
this as a spare weapon, in case anything happens to your sword. It might even prove more effective than a
sword against some enemies. It is very heavy, and if you use it in battle you must deduct 1 from your
Attack Strength because of the difficulty of lifting it. However, each time you hit, you inflict 3
STAMINA points of damage rather than the usual 2.

yourself from it, you must deduct 1 STAMINA point for the cold. You encounter nothing larger than a
mouse over the course of the day, but by late afternoon you can make out a dark shape on the horizon,
which can only be the Forest of Yore. As you draw closer, you are able to start making out the shapes of
the trees on the edge of the forest, and by nightfall you find shelter from the wind beyond those trees. You
are hungry after your lonely march, and you must eat a meal before making camp for the night. Here you

close to the man on the floor. It resembles a very large dog, with two of its front teeth the size of daggers.
The hide of the creature is covered with thick fur, its legs and tail covered with scales. Along the back of
the thing large spikes protrude going from the neck all the way down to the end of the tail, finishing with
a spike the length of a sword. From its mouth drools saliva and its eyes glow a fiery red. When you enter
it quickly sniffs the air then looks at you. The black robed man sees you and says in an amused voice, &quot;Ah,
another visitor. Welcome. You won't mind being the appetizer for my pet would you.&quot; He orders the
creature to attack. You must fight it.

his sword to attack you. You must fight him as well.

You take the time to examine Zengis as you get closer to the city. It is a small but densely packed city,


constrained and limited by the high wall surrounding it - a mark of how dangerous this region is that there
are few buildings outside the city wall. Just a few ramshackle structures built by the desperate or the
hopelessly poor. The extensive docks indicate that most of the city's trade must be done along the River
Kok that runs beside it.
You are waved through the gates by a slovenly looking Man-Orc. The streets are narrow and oppressive
with few gaps between houses, most of which are filled with the refuse and the traffic of citizens going
about their business.
If you want to use the time available before nightfall to do a bit of shopping, turn to 327. If you would
rather spend a few hours wandering the streets and questioning citizens to see if you locate one of the
lieutenants, turn to 182.

In the harsh light of evening, the avenue of gnarled trees and statues provides excellent cover but you fail
to consider the drawbacks. As you edge towards him, a branch snaps underfoot and your heart skips a
beat. The silence broken, you stand dead still. The Dark Elf spins round, eyes narrowing, trying to see
through the snowfall. Although he fails to spot you, it is clear by his expression that he knows he is being
stalked. Turn to 300.

When you enter the inn, you are struck by an almost overpowering aroma. It is lavishly decorated with
furs and coats of arms; the smell being that of sandalwood incense. There are a couple of customers in
here. You go up to the bar and are given a mug of black liquid by an attractive brunette with ivory skin.
&quot;Go on, root beer is free for newcomers.&quot;
As you take a sip of it, you are disgusted at the strong bitter taste but force it down anyway. Root, literally,
meaning from a vegetable...or is it tree?
&quot;Fang grows its own Pungence Roots in the north just before you get to the mountains,&quot; says a man
standing beside you with a mug of the same liquid. &quot;It takes a while to get used to.&quot;
You nod and grin, placing the free drink back on the bar. A meal here of beef and potatoes will cost you 2
Gold Pieces and restores 5 STAMINA points. People are now beginning to fill the room.
&quot;Are you up for a few drinks, stranger? I will pay,&quot; asks the man.

The path ends at a decrepit wooden hut. You examine it, and from looking inside, conclude that the
previous inhabitants are either dead or elsewhere. You try to open the door, but it is heavily locked from
the inside. The framework does look weak from decay, so you might be able to smash the door down.
Test your Skill if you choose to enter the hut. If you are successful, you manage to break open the door

no doubt we will meet again.&quot; You feel a chill pass through you.
Striding away, you make your way to the gates. As you pass the boundary of the city, the feeling of
oppressive weight that has followed you throughout the city, lifts. Turn to 36.

You head west towards the setting sun, making camp before it gets too dark. You must eat a meal.
The following morning you continue west, your path leading you to the banks of the Silver River. There
you are surprised to find a partially-built raft, and signs of a struggle. From the marks on the ground you
work out that three or four people were building the raft when something, or maybe several things - you
cannot imagine what could have left those tracks - came out of the Forest of Spiders, attacked them and
dragged them away. It would be wise to leave before the mysterious attacker returns. Observing that the
river is flowing quickly, and in the direction you want to go, and that the raft looks as if it would have no
trouble bearing your weight, even in its incomplete state, you decide to take advantage of the raft-makers'
misfortune, and head off down river.
You make good time, and by evening you have reached the town of Chalice. A room for the night and a
meal will set you back 4 Gold Pieces and restores 2 STAMINA points, or you can eat your own food and
make camp on the riverbank (deduct one portion of Provisions).
The next day you set out on the river again, making it as far as Silverton, where food and lodgings cost 5
Gold Pieces. If you cannot or will not pay, you will have to eat your own food. Deduct a portion of
Provisions.
Beyond Silverton the river turns north and joins with the Catfish River, which flows straight through Port
Blacksand, so in the morning you take to the water again. However, as you approach the confluence, you
see a large ship, somewhat the worse for wear, which is sailing slowly down the Catfish. You would have
to pass very close to it to get by, and you are not sure that you can steer the raft well enough for that. If
you want to risk it, turn to 218. If you would rather beach the raft and complete your journey on foot, turn
to 373.

You observe a town built on a slant into a hillside whose crest is so high it reaches for the clouds.
Snowflakes are falling, but unable to cover the ground and rooftops; it dissolves creating a slick surface.
You shiver. Your every breath appears before you as hot air meets cold. The road ahead stretches up the
slope and veers out of sight to the left. The other roads are hidden between tightly squeezed residential
buildings and shops. You can hear cheering and the faint howling of beasts far off north as you step off
the pier and make your way through the town gates. A worn down sign towers before you: the main street
before you is named Goldoran Strip. Turn to 309 if you want to begin searching there. Alternatively, you
could explore the Horse Market district to your right (turn to 67), or Dwight's Wharf district to your left

decide to place the Helmet of Fury on your head, make a note of the paragraph you are on and turn to 215.
From the assorted bodies lying on the ground, you also find 2 Gold Pieces and 3 Black Pearls. Each Black
Pearl is worth 3 Gold Pieces if sold.
After your quick search, you leave via the far passageway. Not far down the passageway is a small
opening, obviously once a hidden door but now lying open. Beyond you can smell the sewers. You hear a
rumble behind you as the ground shifts some more, sending stone tumbling into the altar room you just
vacated. You have got out just in time!
You quickly enter the sewer passageway and follow it until you can see light streaming down from a
sewer entrance. Climbing the ladder fixed to the sewer wall, you haul yourself back onto the streets of
Zengis. Turn to 70.

After some consideration, the king allows you to show your discoveries. &quot;Wait!&quot; the grand counsellor
booms. &quot;You speak of treacherous acts with hollow words, adventurer. Your lordship, would you so
easily trust the words of a stranger to one who has served you with honesty and loyalty for many years?
What is to say that the adventurer,&quot; pointing accusingly at you, &quot;is not an accomplice to the traitor, Veda
Loth, staging a heroic fight for evil intentions, to gain your trust and influence your decisions as is now

with. Unimpressed, the king says, &quot;My adventuring friend, with all the excitement you have been through,
it is understandable for you to act as you have. But on the basis of your accounts, I do not see the
necessity to disrespect one of my advisers. Coincidence is the summation of my ruling. Leave now on a

The man introduces himself as Candrid and you introduce yourself in return. Candrid orders the first
round of ale. As you both stand there at the bar getting shoved by others passing by, he tells you that he
was one of the champions who survived Baron Sukumvit's infamous Deathtrap Dungeon years ago. He
had just returned from a mission in Stonebridge and was nearly run over by a wagon driven by two young
lads. You both laugh at this.
He orders a second round. You must temporarily deduct 1 SKILL point since you are starting to feel
dizzy and giddy. The drink is becoming addictive. As his drunkenness continues, he begins to tell about
his participation in the games. He tells you that he was already at the arena earlier in the day and
particularly remembers seeing a Dark Elf managing a giant cage containing a large creature. &quot;Most
vicious it was, it would not let me kiss it on the snout! If I were closer, I'd punch that Elf in his nose for
giving me a vile look. Better yet, I caught the number on the cage; 360, I think. If you see this cage, kill
his pet for me and we will toast on its river of blood.&quot;
He orders a third round. Candrid tells you that as soon as he wins a few tournaments, he is setting out
towards Khul, the Dark Continent, with a few adventuring companions.
He orders yet another round and you must deduct 1 more point of SKILL. By now, he is very wobbly and
you have to grab him by the shirt more than once to stand him straight. He gives you a wooden tube
containing a crystal within it. &quot;Take this if you want to see me fight. You will need to look in there. And
here,&quot; he drops 4 Gold Pieces on to the bar and you quickly grab them before somebody steals a piece,
&quot;You have that. You are a friend now, and I can tell you need help. I hope we meet again.&quot; Add the gold
and far scope to your possessions.
The SKILL losses here are temporary and can be restored by 1 point after each battle you get involved in,
even if you do not fight to the finish. As for Candrid, you do not fancy his chances of getting sober any
time soon. He flops over the counter, barely able to keep his eyes open. You bid him good day. Turn to

search, you had better contact Yaztromo and see if he can bring you back from wherever this is. Turn to
383.
If you still have other places to investigate, you sit down at the edge of a nearby stream to consider what
you should do next. The sight of your reflection in the water gives you a start: a streak of white now runs
through your hair, presumably a side-effect of the Dark Elf's magic. Make a note of this.
It does not take you long to work out that you have been transported into the Moonstone Hills. You
realise that there would be little point in heading back to Zengis to take revenge, and decide to press on to
another of the places where you may find one of the lieutenants. Once you have decided which way to go,
you set off, and are relieved to encounter nothing hostile before sundown. Continuing on your way after
dark would be foolhardy, so you make camp for the night. You must eat a meal.
When you wake, you set off again towards your new objective. If that is Fang, turn to 390. If it is Port

been full of different kinds of creatures. The Nandibear head you see above you is my pride and joy. I
killed that beast three years ago. However, there is something going on in the mountains. Two weeks ago
we were out there and saw a creature that I cannot even describe. It had apparently killed a Rock Demon
and I wouldn't even approach such a creature. It disappeared into a cave in the mountains and there were
two dark-skinned men outside who went in after it. They control the creature somehow, though I have no
interest in finding out how or meeting such people.&quot; Could these men be Dark Elves you wonder? Your

numbered Attack Round (i.e. the second, fourth, sixth etc).

The noise of the arena viewers above echo weakly through the tunnel...then you hear the growling, much
louder now. You must be close to an exit. Shining your light ahead, you see a barrier of wooden planks
that seal the way onwards. At closer inspection, you notice great rents across them and a hole just wide
enough for a head. You could easily force an entrance if you wanted to, but you take a peek at what lies
beyond first. It turns out to be the interior of a large cage housing some kind of monster. You could climb
into the cage then squeeze between the bars to escape. If you possess poison in any form, you could use it
to subdue the beast within until you are safely inside. Cross it off your Adventure Sheet and turn to 108. If
not, climbing in seems too risky. You must reverse crawl back outside. Turn to 318.

Secure in your invisible state you run for the door as quickly as you can - the potion only has a limited
duration. Unfortunately you make at least a little noise in your dash and by the time you reach the door,
several of the Dark Elves are looking in your direction.

A dreadful creature emerges from the archway sending shivers through the audience. The thing before
you has unbelievably huge jaws equipped with piranha-like incisors. Blemished, rubbery skin is pulled
taut over its squat and powerful toad-like body. Regarding the two of you with huge round eyes, it bounds
forward landing on Garn and knocking you aside. Before you can help, its teeth sink into Garn's skull
with a sickening crunch. If you possess a blowpipe and poisoned dart, you have time to use it before
combat begins, but you must fight it alone.

SAW-TOOTH                                   SKILL 8          STAMINA 14

If you strike it with a poisoned weapon, it will continue to lose 2 STAMINA points at the end of each
round until combat is over. Each time the Saw-Tooth wounds you, reduce your STAMINA by 4 due to
the devastating power of its bite. If the monster ever scores two consecutive rounds against you, its jaws
close around your body almost severing you in two. With another snap of its jaws, it swallows you whole!
Your adventure ends here.
If you win, you stumble over its bulk, exhausted and dazed. The spectators amazed with your combat
prowess chant, 'Another battle!' But your deed is done for the time being. The short man holding a scroll
from earlier comes to you accompanied by guards.
&quot;Fine show, un good haul too, warrior. Here's yer share.&quot; He presses a pouch of 12 Gold Pieces on to you.

You pause at the entrance, then pluck up your courage and enter. Add 1 LUCK point for making it into
the Dark Elves' lair.
You cautiously move into the tunnel. A short way ahead you see a flicking light which reveals a large
natural cavern. Numerous stalagmites and stalactites, including some huge examples, span from floor to
ceiling blocking the view of the entire cave. Several campfires give off light that sparkles off the natural
pillars. Around the fires are numerous forms: Dark Elves!
There is plenty of cover nearby so you move into the shadows and conceal yourself behind a group of
stalagmites. You spend some time observing the layout of the cavern and the activity of the Dark Elves. It
occurs to you that the Dark Elves have not posted any guards to the outside entrance. They have
obviously placed their faith in the magical defences that guard their outpost.
There must be at least a hundred Dark Elves here. Most are in small groups around the individual
campfires, but some are guarding a door on the far right-hand side of the cavern. Slaves of all races are
occasionally let through the door. This must be the slave quarters. Closer, also on the right-hand wall, is
another door, this one unguarded. On the left-hand wall is a tunnel that leads out of the cavern. After
observing for some time you see a group of six Dark Elves enter the cavern from this tunnel. You cannot
quite make out the other side of the cavern through its concealing features. There may be other tunnels
you cannot see on the far side.
If you possess a Doppelganger Potion, this may be a good time to drink it. If you do, write down the name
of a person you have encountered on your adventure who you wish to impersonate.

Make your way along the left-hand wall towards the tunnel leading out of the cavern (turn to 386)?

As you enter the shop you are surprised at its petite size, yet it is crammed to the ceiling with equipment
and peculiar items. A stout Gnome wearing spectacles smiles slightly at you from behind the counter.
&quot;Welcome to Wixil's. How can I assist you?&quot;
If you fancy a spot of thievery, you may decide to rob the shopkeeper. If so, turn to 334 immediately.
Otherwise, you may buy any of the items on sale:

Blowpipe                                  6 Gold Pieces

Provisions                                1 Gold Piece per meal

The blowpipe comes with three darts coated in poison. The far scope will allow you to view distant
locations when you peer through it. Nectars are a kind of healing plant that can be crushed and rubbed on
to wounds. There is enough for three applications, each restoring up to 4 points of STAMINA. You may
use them separately or all at once.
As you browse through the equipment, you hear a faint cooing beside you and something brushes against
your leg. You are surprised to see a creature unlike any you have ever seen. It looks like a small cow with
a body covered in a thick, brown hide blemished with red spots. It stares back at you with large,
inquisitive eyes. You move to pat it and are somewhat horrified when it gives a friendly growl at the same
time revealing its massive jaws containing dragon-like fangs.
&quot;Don't worry about him. It's a gentle Gantamaran Calf. Give it food and it'll be as loyal as a bristle beast,
or so I have been told.&quot; He laughs to himself as he comes around to where you are standing. &quot;Fear not,
he's only young. When he gets older, he'll grow bigger than this house. Eating machine it is. I mean, it
eats literally anything when it's hungry - meat, metal, bricks, bones - so I've no worries about feeding it.
I'm hoping to enter it into the arena to fight and win me a few battles. I'd hate to let him go, but if you
have the money, I will not hesitate to sell him to you.&quot; If you want to buy the creature, he will sell it to
you for 9 Gold Pieces.

Though the storekeepers are more than willing to do business in the few hours they are open, you will
hardly find anyone who knows of a Dark Elf here. Nevertheless, you find the following items interesting:

Provisions                                2 Gold Pieces per meal
Empty Glass Bottle                        1 Gold Piece

Healing Draught                           8 Gold Pieces

You may buy no more than three Provisions as people are rationing food. The axe is heavier than a sword
but no better, no worse in combat. The ring increases your agility � when you Test your Skill, you may
deduct 1 from the dice roll. The healing draught restores STAMINA equal to half your Initial score

You make your way through the crowd, leaving a stream of curses in your wake. Getting into the side
street, you pick up speed and dash after the thief, who has just turned into an alleyway ahead. Turning the
corner you trip on a wire strung across the alleyway, your momentum propelling you into a pile of refuse
heaped against the wall. The force of the impact stuns you; lose 1 STAMINA point. As you lie in the
refuse you hear heavy footsteps behind you. Clumsily turning, you see a large man, the thief's 'victim'
striding towards you with a club raised and a sinister smirk on his face. You must fight the robber.

BRIGAND                                   SKILL 7         STAMINA 10

Since you are fighting from the ground you must subtract 1 from your SKILL until you get to your feet. If

Valgan fights by casting bolts of twisting and rolling energy at you - bolts of pure chaos! Any armour you
may be wearing has no effect in this battle. Whenever he wins an Attack Round, roll one die and consult
the table below to find the effect the chaos magic has upon you:


Dice roll        Effect
1                Wild energy revitalises you adding 1 to your STAMINA and 3 to that of the Dark Elf's.
2-5              A chaos bolt hammers into you inflicting an amount of STAMINA damage equal to the
                 number rolled.
6                Chaotic energy leeches into your body drawing out something vital. Lose 1 point of
                 SKILL, STAMINA, and LUCK.

By evening you can see the River Kok, which leads to Zengis, and the sight encourages you to quicken
your pace. About an hour later you see a barge travelling up river, and a man calls to you from it, asking
if you are going to Zengis. When you say that you are, he tells you that one of his guards has fallen sick
after eating poisoned fruit, and asks if you would be willing to take the sick guard's place. You accept
without hesitation, glad of the opportunity to speed up your journey, and the barge draws close enough to
the riverbank for you to leap aboard.
The barge owner introduces himself as Peadar, and explains that he cannot pay any money for your
services until he's sold his cargo, but he can at least give you something to eat before you go on duty.
&quot;Only bread and cheese, I'm afraid, but there's plenty of it, and...&quot; he gives a nervous laugh, &quot;at least it's
not poisoned.&quot;
The meal restores no STAMINA, but it does fill your stomach, and there's enough left over to make up an
extra portion of Provisions, which you stow in your backpack before taking up your post. Unfortunately a
small raiding party of Fish Men has targeted your vessel and attacks under cover of darkness. You have to
fight one of them.

FISH MAN                                   SKILL 7          STAMINA 6

The sound of howling wakes you, and you reach for your sword, ready to defend yourself against the wolf
pack that must surely be close by. Your campfire has gone out, but there is enough moonlight for you to
see your surroundings, and you look around, trying to see where the wolves are. Again the howling
sounds, and you realise that it is coming from overhead. You glance up, expecting to spot the pack
advancing down a hill towards you, and are surprised to catch sight of several distant forms in mid-air,
silhouetted against the moon, gliding on large wings. One of the lupine beasts breaks away from the
others and swoops down towards you, baring its fangs to attack.

AAKOR                                      SKILL 7          STAMINA 8

If you have not killed it within 5 Attack Rounds, the rest of the pack flies down to be in at the kill. You
have no hope of defending yourself against them all at once, and they tear you to shreds in the light of the
moon before settling down to lap up your blood. If you take no more than 5 Attack Rounds to defeat it,
the others fly off in search of easier prey. Nevertheless, you remain awake for the rest of the night, and set
off again as the sun's rays begin to creep across the horizon.

You arrive at the Arches situated near the city walls. It is so called because its structure is comprised of
many tall archways built on top of one another as though the dwellings above were supported by stilts.
The central towering construction is the most impressive, stabbing high enough to reach the clouds. The
design is ancient, probably serving as a lookout post, and you decide to head there. It takes you a while to
locate anything that might lead upwards but when you finally spot a half-hidden door, you are denied
entry until you pay a fee of 5 Gold Pieces or a magical item for admittance. If you cannot afford this price,
nothing you do will shift the burly doormen and you must leave. Turn to 151 at once.
If you make the payment, continue reading.

You are escorted up a winding staircase then through a series of narrow corridors. Eventually, you are sat
down in a rich lounge where a tall man, handsomely dressed, is observing the world outside through a
speculum - from what you know a larger and more complex type of far scope. The guard tells you to wait
before leaving the room. After a few minutes in awkward silence, your host finally acknowledges you. He
introduces himself as Spymaster Olibruh, a delver of secrets and conspiracies. You decide to be honest
and tell him why you seek his aid. Olibruh knows a great deal about the city and has witnessed many
events. He has no information on a Dark Elf lieutenant, however. But, he has noticed an interesting fact.
&quot;Ever since the king's grand counsellor returned from a diplomatic mission, things have been going
visibly downhill. Soldiers have left the city to confront an invasion force from the east, but I have not
spotted any sign of this great enemy, not even by magical means. I suspect this to be a deliberate and
tactical move suggested by a traitor possibly in league with the Dark Elves. Salamonis is a powerful city
quite capable of thwarting their plans, if they knew about it, and would therefore pose an obvious threat.
Their goal would be a lot easier if say, the city's armies were removed from the equation. That is all I can

As the day wears on, the distance between you and the Barbarian grows, though you keep pace with each
other.
As the sky darkens, you can make out the sound of rushing water up ahead. This must be the River Kok,
beyond which lies Fang. There is little chance of your being able to make a crossing before daybreak, so
you make camp for the night. Away to your right, the Barbarian does likewise.
You must eat: deduct one portion of Provisions, but do not restore any STAMINA for the meal. Your rest
during the night is uneasy, as you fear that the Barbarian might sneak up on you to kill you in your sleep,
but your fears prove unfounded. The animals of the plains must be wary of the Barbarian as well, for
nothing comes close to you all night. Restore 1 STAMINA point for what little rest you get.
In the morning you carry on towards your destination, as does the Barbarian. A small ferry has moored
this side of the river, and on the far side you can see the wall that surrounds Fang. The ferryman rubs his
hands in anticipation as he catches sight of you, his first customer of the day. His smile fades as he sees
the Barbarian approaching as well, and he scurries over to meet you.
&quot;You want to get to Fang, yes?&quot; he mutters. You tell him that you do, and he says, &quot;Keep me safe from
him,&quot; with a gesture towards the Barbarian, &quot;and I take you across for just one Gold.&quot;
You accept his terms, and stand guard as he waits for the Barbarian to arrive, and charges him 3 Gold

You manage to squirm free a split second before the beast is upon you. You hear its grunting and feel its
boiling breath on your face as you leap out of harm's way. Those three cowering behind you are less
fortunate. They are crushed to a bloody pulp by the beast's body. The door fractures under the massive
impact and the audience roars with excitement. You pick yourself up from the sandy floor as the beast
shakes its head, recovering from the incident. It looks over its horned shoulder at you and rises painfully
to its feet; a shard of bone is sticking out of its left arm. You move in to finish the job.

fallen companions. Needing no invitation, you rush over to help him. While the man is fighting beside

pass the Forest of Spiders, a dark and forbidding mass of trees that you are glad to put behind you. In the
evening you pass the mouth of Trolltooth Pass, and you make camp at the foot of a mountain too high for

you dare not sleep for fear of the dangers that lurk nearby. Deduct 1 STAMINA point for lack of sleep.
You are eager to resume your journey in the morning. Turn to 32.

&quot;I knew you wouldn't let us down,&quot; Yaztromo says elated. &quot;Having dealt with all the agents of evil and
acquired the components key to locating the portal, your quest is almost complete. Only their leader, the
dark priest remains. But, thanks to you, we will have no problem finding him. Quickly now, tell me of
these discoveries.&quot;
You describe the tooth-pieces for the wizard to continue his research. This is great news and you feel your
confidence boost sky-high. For your achievement you may increase your Initial SKILL or LUCK by 1, or
increase your Initial STAMINA by 2. Restore that Attribute to this new maximum.
&quot;I have it!&quot; you hear as the ring crackles back into life. Eager to get going, you ask Yaztromo if he has
found the Chaos Gate. &quot;Yes. Well...no, not exactly - more like an indication. We have been searching for
the lieutenants across Allansia hoping that one of them would be crucial to finding the Dark Elf
headquarters in one of the bigger cities. In a way, we have been led on a wild goose chase. The base isn't
out there at all. It's here, in Darkwood!&quot;
You sigh despondently. So you know the portal is in a base somewhere in Darkwood which, of course,
would take days to reach and weeks to search its entirety.
&quot;Stop fretting for a moment,&quot; Yaztromo continues, &quot;Did I say I was finished? The base is on the western
edge of Darkwood but something or someone is blocking my magic. I can't get an exact location so I'm
afraid you will have to discover it by yourself. The tooth-pieces you hold originate from the same location
as the Chaos Gate. I can sense their magic and tap into it, weak though it is, through the copper ring. And
through my studies, I have learnt a Tooth Warp spell powerful enough to transport you practically all the
way to their doorstep avoiding the dangers of Darkwood Forest. Alternatively, if you are running low on
supplies I could teleport you to my tower where you can rest and restock. Of course, that would mean you
having to go through the forest on your own. Either way, you are quite a distance away and carry a lot on
your person. I suggest you'd better lose some baggage in order for the spell to work.&quot;

You can take with you no more than 12 items of equipment. Each portion of Provisions counts as one
item but your pouch of gold can be treated as a single item. Rings, keys and tooth-pieces are light enough
to be negligible. Do not count your backpack or clothing either. Everything else counts as one item each.
Decide what you wish to take or leave behind and amend your Adventure Sheet accordingly. When you
are finished, you inform Yaztromo that you are ready to receive his spell.

If you want to be transported to the tower, turn to 389 immediately.
If you would rather be transported into the forest, all goes hazy and then you find yourself in Darkwood.
Recovering from the effects, you observe your new surroundings. Turn to 326.

Your failure to deal with even one of the emissaries of evil leaves them free to carry out their master's
orders. With only the tooth-piece you began with, Yaztromo cannot breach the enchantments that prevent
him from discovering the portal's location and thus, has no idea where it could be. Soon the hellish
monsters, the vile hordes of the Pit will be released and Chaos shall rule Allansia. Realising the extent of
your failure, you sink to your knees as the wizard grimly informs you that all is lost.

The tavern is cramped and smoky, and the labourers huddled over their pint pots pay you little attention
as you make your way over to the bar. The landlord is carving a piece of wood, and as you draw near, he
puts it down but keeps hold of his knife. You place three gold pieces on the bar, and request a meal and a
room. The landlord mumbles an unintelligible response, puts the knife away, takes the money, and
shuffles over to a hatch at the rear of the bar, calling through for a dish of stew. The wood he has been
carving catches your eye. While not yet finished, it is obviously a miniature bust of a young man, with a
curving scar on his chin.
&quot;Is my son, Stief.&quot; The landlord's voice alerts you to the fact that he has returned to the counter. &quot;Not
from Salamonis way, are you?&quot;
You shake your head.
&quot;Pity. Thought you might have word of him. He went there to join the army just after the Beast came
through, and we've heard nothing of him since.&quot;
Curious, you ask about the Beast.
&quot;You've not heard of the Beast? Foul creature, it was. Eight foot tall, all scales and claws, came to Coven
last summer. Killed a local man before we could drive it away. And Stief said he wanted to become a
soldier and help keep decent folks safe from the likes o' the Beast, and that was the last we saw of him.&quot;
You mention that you are headed south, and say that if you should see Stief, you will let him know that
his family misses him. Note that if you encounter Stief in the course of your quest, you may talk to him
by multiplying the paragraph number you are currently on by 3 and turning to that new section without
reading any further. You may recognise him for the curved scar he has on his chin.
The landlord smiles. &quot;Tell him we don't need him to come home, or ought like that, just to know he's safe
and well.&quot; He fills a mug with ale and hands it to you. &quot;On the house. The name's Jaak, by the way.&quot;
Moments later your stew arrives, and you continue to talk with Jaak while you eat it. Afterwards you
retire to the room which has been prepared for you. It is basic, but comfortable. You may restore 4 points
of STAMINA for the hearty meal and the night's rest.
In the morning you get up bright and early and continue on your way. If you are heading towards
Warpstone, you carry on towards Trolltooth Pass (turn to 301). If your destination is Salamonis, you

As you trudge northwards, back across the same ground you were covering in Tareg's caravan not so long
ago, you begin to wonder if you really are up to the challenge of finding and defeating the Dark Elf
Lieutenants and preventing the opening of the Chaos Gate. Distracted by your doubts, you do not notice
the large figure in the distance as quickly as you would have under normal circumstances. By the time
you do see it, you can tell that it is a Hill Troll. The Troll has obviously seen you, as it is heading your
way. You bite your lip, reflecting that at least your first fight on this quest will be against a familiar type
of opponent.
More familiar than you think, for as the Troll draws closer, it gives a start of recognition. &quot;You's the
yooman what killed Brokenose and Fatfist!&quot; it roars, &quot;And broke my arm!&quot;
Enraged, the Troll raises a large warhammer above its head - or rather, it tries to, but lets out a bellow of
pain before its arm has gone all the way up. Evidently the broken arm has not healed well. Nevertheless,
the Troll charges towards you, roaring its fury, and you have no choice but to fight the beast again, this
time to the death.

The grass begins to get shorter. The ground is beginning to rise too, as you have finally reached the base
of the hills you saw earlier. Up ahead, you hear the sound of flowing water. All of a sudden, there is a
warm feeling on your finger; Yaztromo is contacting you. &quot;You are near the base, though you are still a
little too far east of it,&quot; is all he says. The ring then feels cold again. Getting ready to head back to the
junction, you suddenly feel a sharp pain in your shoulder. Lose 2 STAMINA points. An arrow has hit you,
and you turn to face your aggressor. You are surprised to see a powerful-looking Dark Elf riding a Giant
Stag Beetle. &quot;We were expecting some ill-prepared attempt to thwart our plans,&quot; the Dark Elf sneers, &quot;But
you will not succeed.&quot; He takes another shot at you. If you do not have a shield, Test your Skill, adding 2
to the roll. If you are successful, you manage to evade the arrow. If you are unsuccessful, the arrow hits
your sword arm. Lose 1 SKILL point and 2 STAMINA points. If you do have a shield, the arrow is
deflected away. You charge forward and the Dark Elf draws his sword.

You locate an empty seat with a decent view of the arena. If you own a far scope, you can use it to
observe the battles more closely. Turn to 150 immediately.

Someone taps you on the shoulder and you turn to see a thin, spectacled man dressed like a scribe.
&quot;Greetings. Care to place a wager on the next battle?&quot; If you have any money, you can place a bet and he
quills down your details.
Suddenly, a horn bellows out and all heads turn to the oval pit. An announcer stands in the centre
shouting babble you cannot even discern. Then the double doors open, releasing a pair of bony Pit Fiends.
They chase the announcer all over the arena creating hysterical laughter from the audience...until he is
caught and eaten alive! The dinosaur-like predators are ushered back to their paddocks and the horn
sounds again. Baron Sukumvit has taken his place on the throne and as he lowers a red flag, the crowd
roars their approval. The thrill of the Battle Pit is about to begin.

The audience cheers as a motley band of adventurers stride out of the left-hand doors. They are led by a
warrior named Candrid who is apparently of some repute in Fang. Their opponent, coming out of the
right-hand doors, is a large shaggy-furred creature standing upright on muscular legs. It flexes its
powerful claws as it regards its next meal. With a chilling howl from its toothy maw, combat ensues!

At this point, you may place a bet on one of the combatants you wish to win the fight. You may bet up to
10 Gold Pieces maximum. Then fight out the battle until one combatant is dead. The outcome of the battle
determines whether you won or lost. If you won, regain 1 LUCK point and then double the amount you
wagered and collect your winnings. For example, if you bet 3 Gold Pieces, you get your 3 coins back plus
another 3. If you lost, tough! Your gold is gone!

After you have seen or gambled enough, you decide to wander around before the next combat starts.
Pushing past a repugnant fatso, you descend a flight of steps and spot an unguarded doorway several
yards to your right.

If you want to head in that direction, turn to 304.
If you decide to register for battle after all, you can look for the short man with a scroll earlier, who is
more than glad to sign you in. Turn to 289.

You enter a crowded shop filled with all manner of strange things. There are jars filled with concoctions
lining the wall. Body parts of all manner of creatures are stuffed into every available space. The counter
ahead holds a number of supposedly magic artefacts, while a sign behind the counter proclaims boldly the
many services and enchantments this shop offers.
What little light that makes it into the shop reveals a young man behind the counter. You can see several
small lizards moving under his clothes and poking their heads out of his many pockets. You question him
and soon find out that yes, he is Malfeous the Talented, and yes, he is available for business.
Examining his sign and his wares, most things are either of little use to you or far too expensive but you
do see several things that strike your interest.


Malfeous's Restorative                     6 Gold Pieces
Healing Salve                              3 Gold Pieces
Potion of Luck                             5 Gold Pieces
Potion of Invisibility                     7 Gold Pieces
Potion of Climbing                         2 Gold Pieces
Empty Glass Bottle                         1 Gold Piece
Rune Stone                                 4 Gold Pieces

Malfeous's Restorative potion restores up to 1 SKILL point and 6 STAMINA points overnight if drunk
before going to sleep. The Healing Salve restores 5 STAMINA points of damage anytime except during
combat. The Potion of Luck restores 1-3 points of LUCK when drunk (roll one die, halve the number
rolled and round up to determine the number of LUCK points restored). The Potion of Invisibility has
only a short duration but allows you to add 2 to your Attack Strength for the first 4 Attack Rounds if you
drink it before combat. It may also be useful to avoid foes outside combat at times when indicated during
your adventure. The Potion of Climbing, if drunk before you Test your Skill to climb, gives you an
automatic success on that roll. The Empty Glass Bottles may come in handy if you ever need a container
to store liquid. Malfeous swears that the Rune Stone is enchanted, pointing to small runes of Death,
Magic and Earth on the stone, but he hasn't been able to determine its exact magical properties.
Malfeous can also cast the spell of Malfeous's Restorative on you at this time, for a cost of 4 Gold Pieces.
Its effects are as the potion above but only for this coming night.
When you are finished here, if you next want to enter the shop marked 'Talson's Travel Maps,' turn to 250.
If you want to browse the stalls and see what they have on offer, turn to 364. If you have had enough of
shopping and want to leave the square, turn to 4.

You have not gone far when you come across a robed man sitting cross-legged against a wall. In front of
him are several carved figurines. One in particular catches your eye: a small statuette of a Black Panther.
&quot;You know a prize when you see one, stranger,&quot; the man says in a deep voice. &quot;These are all my creations
but that is the most valuable. My craft brings them life...and yet, I cannot make a living out of them.
Maybe the Black Panther will serve you better.&quot;
The man wants 9 Gold Pieces for the statuette and explains how it works. With a few arcane words, you
can summon a magical Black Panther to fight in your place for one battle. The Black Panther has SKILL
11 and STAMINA 9. It takes all your energy to control the Panther when summoned so you cannot fight
at the same time. If the Black Panther is killed, the statuette loses its magic properties and you must
continue the fight yourself. You may summon it only once then the statuette loses its power, so even if the
Panther wins the fight, it will still vanish afterwards. Decide whether or not you want to buy it and make
the necessary alterations and notes to your Adventure Sheet.
When you are ready to move on, turn to 69.

You come to a building decorated with dozens of curios and sigils. You try to peak inside but the
windows are covered totally with posters and advertisements of various magicians. It's certainly an
interesting place. You manage to knock once before the door swings open loosely. The interior is full of
parchments and knick-knacks, the likes of which you have never seen. You have to tread some underfoot
in order to enter. The corridor leads you into a small, equally cluttered room and you shout loudly for
attention. It appears no one is home. Then you notice, right in the middle of a round table, a single playing
card. Will you turn the card over (turn to 16) or leave and search elsewhere (turn to 151)?

Valgan becomes more and more desperate as you drive him back, wounded. You press your attack
furiously knowing that victory is going to be yours. Something changes in Valgan's eyes. There is a look
of hatred and...resignation.
&quot;You may think you have won,&quot; he spits, &quot;but if I must die, I will destroy you, your friends and all the
other so called Forces of Good as well.&quot;
He hurls himself backwards, into the portal. The energy of the portal consumes Valgan in an instant, but

As you move towards the Dark Elf, he gestures, and the Skeleton Warrior attacking him disintegrates,
collapsing in a shower of fine dust. At the same time your weapon turns away from the Dark Elf sorcerer.
His magic protects him.
The Dark Elf turns to face you. His cruelly handsome face appears unlined by years but his intense,
ancient gaze gives lie to this first impression.
He smiles and says, &quot;Curious. Only someone looking specifically for a Dark Elf could pierce my illusions.
Let's see. Wait!&quot; he commands as you start to speak. He takes a considering look at you. &quot;Why would an
adventurer be looking for a Dark Elf in Zengis, of all places? Ah, you must be looking for the infiltrators
into human lands, adventurer. I would theorise that, since you are searching for them, thus you must not
know the location of the ritual, or indeed the full plan. And the possibility exists that you realise each of
the lieutenants carries an artefact that may help you to track the location.&quot; He laughs coldly at your
shocked expression.
It seems this Dark Elf is not one of the lieutenants you are looking for. But you are suspicious of his
presence in Zengis and ask him what his purpose is in the city.
&quot;I suppose I must satisfy your curiosity. I am tracking down the so-called 'hero of Zengis' and I will
explain why. In every age, there are heroes of light and darkness, law and chaos. They are the pivotal
pieces of the battle between opposing sides and are the channel of great spiritual energy. Furthermore, as
the hero's deeds grow, they become an integral piece of the unseen tapestry of common linkages that bind
a community together. With me so far, hmm?&quot;
&quot;I intend to collect these heroes, both light and dark, and through my arcane mastery tap into this power,
to become the ruling piece on the board which is this world. Even the gods will bow to my dominance.&quot;
He doesn't laugh madly as you would expect, but just smiles faintly.
&quot;So you need not worry, adventurer. I am not interested in the pitiful little schemes of my inferior
comrades. In fact, I may just be willing to help you...for the right price. I can tell you right now that none
of the lieutenants are in this city.&quot;
He is willing to answer one of your questions in return for any one of the following artefacts that interest
him: the Helmet of Fury, the Eldritch Rod, the Sword of Tamahelos and the Dragonstone Sceptre.
If you have one of these artefacts and wish to offer it in exchange for a question, cross it off your
Adventure Sheet and turn to 365.
If you are wearing the Helmet of Fury and wish to offer it in exchange for a question, instead turn to 241.

The numerous patrons are not much cleaner either. You wind your way through the various cut-throats

You wipe the blood off of your weapon. As you rest from the battle, you feel a warm sensation on one of
your fingers. It comes from the ring that Yaztromo gave you; he is contacting you. You listen carefully to
what he has to say. &quot;You have gone too far east! Turn back and head west again!&quot; is all he says before he

As you describe the final rune he tells you the spell required to open the magical door. You recite it out
loud. As you finish it, a giant fireball springs from the door. Unable to avoid it in time, you lose 5
STAMINA points for the serious burns that it causes. If you are still alive, Yaztromo asks for you to
describe the runes again to find out the problem. You tell him about the smudged rune and his tone of
voice changes.

Your weapon flies straight and true striking him a fatal blow. Delgar coughs up blood, cursing you with
his dying breath then collapses inert. For a moment you expect a terrible fate to befall you, but the
moment passes. It seems the lieutenant's power was solely in trickery and has no real magic.
The king thanks Sir Rowan for his salvation. The knight bows and returns your weapon to you, patting
you on the shoulder. &quot;Your prowess and valour match those of us knights. I hope we meet again. I believe
this is what you require, warrior.&quot; He gives you an item found on Delgar's body. It is one of the
tooth-pieces you are looking for! You notice it has three stretched runes engraved on to it. Thrilled, you

Otherwise, you continue north for a little while before making camp for the night, again deducting one
portion of Provisions or losing 3 STAMINA points for going hungry.
In the morning you set off north again, keeping an eye out for any of the more hostile inhabitants of the
hills (turn to 237).

You say a silent prayer as you leap from the speeding carriage. Fortunately a mulberry bush cushions
your fall. Lose only 1 STAMINA point. You catch up with the Dark Elf soon enough who snarls upon
seeing you again. &quot;If what you seek is death by my hand, so be it!&quot; There is no escaping this combat for
either of you.

You head deeper into the city, looking for any sign of thieves that could lead you to the Noose. Test your
Luck. If you are Lucky, you see a pickpocket working the crowds. Following discreetly, you find yourself

You enter the jeweller's shop where a young woman in an expensive, many-coloured dress greets you
warmly. &quot;Welcome traveller. I am Aliana Moonshine. Are you looking for something in particular; maybe
something for a certain special someone?&quot;
You explain that you are just browsing and would like to see what she is offering.
&quot;You look like someone who gets into a fight every once in a while. Maybe I can interest you in some of
my magical amulets.&quot;
You quickly say yes and she picks out three items that you may find interesting:

Bracelet of Agility                       8 Gold Pieces
Sun Amulet                                10 Gold Pieces
Ice Crystal                               10 Gold Pieces

The Bracelet of Agility makes you faster at dodging attacks in combat, adding 1 to your Attack Strength
while you wear it. The Sun Amulet can be used during combat to blind your enemy so that you
automatically win the next two Attack Rounds (you may use LUCK normally to increase damage). It can
be used only once. The Ice Crystal shoots a bolt of ice at your opponent who suffers 6 STAMINA points
of damage instantly, but it can only be used once. Buy whatever you wish, then proceed along Opal Street.

While the Salamonis army may not yet have achieved their goal, they have made Trolltooth Pass a safer
place to be, at least for the moment. You encounter no hostile creatures on the rest of your journey
through it. Towards midday you emerge onto the edge of the Windward Plain, and turn south. A sharp
breeze blows almost constantly here, and if you do not have a cloak to protect yourself, you must lose 1
STAMINA point. If this does not kill you, you make good progress during the day, and just as you are
starting to think about making camp for the night, you catch sight of the wall which surrounds Salamonis,

Mid-morning you catch sight of a village a little to the north, but you decide that you cannot spare the
time to visit it, and press on towards Zengis. Checking the map, you note that your trek will take you
close to the notorious Firetop Mountain, said to be the home of an evil wizard and hordes of Orcs and
Goblins. As you continue on your way, your gaze is constantly drawn to the mountain, and you are alert
to any sign of movement from that direction. Nothing hostile comes anywhere near you, though.
Eventually night falls once more, and you make camp by a cluster of boulders. As before, you must eat a
meal. Unfortunately, the wolves of Firetop Mountain are particularly restless this night. Their howling
keeps you awake and you must deduct 1 point of STAMINA due to lack of sleep.
At dawn, you hurry onwards (turn to 392).

The door opens into the chamber of Lord Mordin who can be seen tucked away in his four-poster bed.
There are a few expensive trinkets and letters on his desk which look interesting and you creep inside so
as to not awaken the room's occupant. You have taken only a couple of steps when you detect a click and
you freeze. One of the desk draws opens and a small missile streaks towards you. Test your Luck. If you
are Lucky, the dart misses you. If not, it thuds painfully into your arm - lose 2 STAMINA points. Either
way, Lord Mordin is now awake and cries for help. He does not see your face as you rush back outside
and down the stairs. You may not return to this floor. Turn to 168.

your face. Lose 1 STAMINA point. You land heavily on the floor and see the other two men also moving
in to give you a beating. The other patrons look on fearfully and disappear from the tavern. The bartender
runs out on to the street calling for guards. Unless you are wearing heavy gauntlets, you must reduce your
Attack Strength by 2 during this fight only as you have to fight the men with your fists - you do not wish

It is starting to get dark. You must find the base soon, or you will be forced to sleep inside the infernal
forest. You cannot imagine what sorts of night creatures await you here. The ground is now gradually
rising; you have reached the base of the low hills you saw earlier. Suddenly, the copper ring feels warm -
Yaztromo is contacting you. His ghostly voice says, &quot;I have been sensing your actions, and you are now
very close to the Dark Elf base. Just keep heading towards the river. Watch out!&quot; The ring goes cold again.
You are puzzled at why he warned you. Looking up, your heart sinks. Two winged reptiles have spotted
you as their next meal. As they descend, one of them breathes a stream of fire directly at you! Test your
Luck. If you are Lucky, you avoid the blast. If you are Unlucky, the fire scorches you for 4 STAMINA
points of damage. Escaping is not an option - they would catch up with you easily. You must fight them
one at a time.

Before long you leave the Moonstone Hills behind you, and a little later you find a river bubbling out of
the ground, and pause to quench your thirst (add 1 STAMINA point). Following the course of the river
leads you to a town named Karn not long before sunset, and you decide that you have travelled enough
for today. A room and a meal at a tavern will set you back 3 Gold Pieces, and you can add 2 STAMINA

ludicrous and empty allegations. The court is in an uproar and the king cuts you short of further gibberish.

&quot;Well, two is better than one, I guess,&quot; Yaztromo groans disappointedly, &quot;Though that does mean that two
Dark Elf lieutenants are still at large. But let us not worry about that since there are more pressing matters
at hand. Quickly now, tell me of this new discovery.&quot;
You describe the tooth-piece and are then made to wait anxiously as the wizard continues his research.
But your meagre accomplishment dulls your confidence and you will need to muster all the wits and
courage you have left for the final challenge. Deduct 1 point of SKILL and 3 points of LUCK in view of
this.
&quot;I have it!&quot; you hear as the ring crackles back into life. Eager to get going, you ask Yaztromo if he has
found the Chaos Gate. &quot;Yes. Well...no, not exactly - only a vague indication. We have been searching for
the lieutenants across Allansia hoping that one of them would be crucial to finding the Dark Elf
headquarters in one of the bigger cities. In a way, we have been led on a wild goose chase. The base isn't
out there at all. It's here, in Darkwood!&quot;
You sigh despondently. So you know the portal is in a base somewhere in Darkwood which, of course,
would take days to reach and weeks to search its entirety.
&quot;Stop fretting for a moment,&quot; Yaztromo continues, &quot;Did I say I was finished? The base is on the western
edge of Darkwood but something or someone is blocking my magic. I can't get an exact location so I'm
afraid you will have to discover it by yourself. The tooth-pieces you hold originate from the same location
as the Chaos Gate. I can sense their magic, weak though it is, through the copper ring. But there is too
little to work with and I cannot tap into the source. All I can do is teleport you to my tower and you can
make your way through the forest from there. You are quite a distance away, however, and carry a lot on
your person. I suggest you'd better lose some baggage in order for the spell to work.&quot;

You can take with you no more than 12 items of equipment. Each portion of Provisions counts as one
item but your pouch of gold can be treated as a single item. Rings, keys and tooth-pieces are light enough
to be negligible. Do not count your backpack or clothing either. Everything else counts as one item each.
Decide what you wish to take or leave behind and amend your Adventure Sheet accordingly. When you

You have had many vivid dreams in your life but none like the one just then - such dreams aren't natural.
You are too experienced to dismiss your suspicions as simple paranoia. Could it have been some sort of
enchantment? Is someone out to get you, perhaps? You give the room a thorough search, looking behind
every painting, every drawer. Nothing...until you remember - your bedtime snack. Sure enough, you find
mixed in with the broth some powdery traces. A sample is all it takes to give you visions of a dagger
stabbing into your heart. You shake your head to snap out of your stupor - a compound that brings about
hallucinations as you suspected. You must discover more, but you have little time for a full investigation
as dawn is fast approaching. The door has been locked.

you choose to climb upwards). Lose 2 points of STAMINA for each failed attempt due to abrasions.

You follow the narrow dirt path northward, always alert for the dangers of Darkwood Forest. The tall
trees are a menacing sight, and Yaztromo's tower is soon out of view. By now, the vegetation around you
is getting thicker the deeper you head into Darkwood. Little light passes through the canopy above. You
occasionally hear the rustling of bushes caused by startled animals. Eventually you reach a junction where

Add 1 to your LUCK for surviving the attack. A few of the survivors start to search the bodies of the dead.


You join them, then quickly leave before the watch arrives, or worse, more of these creatures. Roll one
die and consult the table below to see what you find:

1.       Nothing but the gruesome remains of the dead.
2.       3 Gold Pieces which have been scattered on the floor during the fight.
3.       A pouch containing Gold Pieces (roll one die and add 1 to the result to find out how many).
4.       A Lucky Charm which you hope will bring you more luck than its previous owner. Whenever
         you Test your Luck, you may deduct 1 from the total rolled.
5.       You find one of the Skeleton Warriors' severed skulls. Inside its eye sockets are 2 Black Pearls
         which you can take. Each is worth 3 Gold Pieces if you decide to sell them.
6.       You pick up one of the Skeleton Warriors' weapons. This Ancient Sword is keenly sharp and adds
         1 to your Attack Strength if you use it. It is also brittle with age. If you ever roll double 1 when
         rolling for your Attack Strength, the weapon breaks and you must fight the rest of the battle
         without the benefit of a weapon, subtracting 2 from your SKILL till the battle ends and you can
         draw another weapon.

Back on the street, you decide that since trouble seems to follow you and having no better idea, you make
your way back to the devastated area of city. Could this devastation be caused by one of the Dark Elf
lieutenants? You vow to keep your eyes open for any signs.
As you are thinking, you hear the sound of combat ahead. There is a Skeleton Warrior at the end of the
street, fighting...a Dark Elf! You look again with surprise but it's definitely a Dark Elf. It is turned away
from you and is concentrating on the Skeleton Warrior - this is the right time to strike. You rush forward

In a wooded clearing you find a spread-eagled corpse in an advanced state of decomposition, its limbs
attached to stakes in the ground. Strangely, the skull has already lost every scrap of flesh. Curious as to
what could have caused it to decay so much more quickly than the rest of the body, you lean in a little too
close, and when the skull's gaping jaws snap shut without warning it almost takes off the tip of your nose.
Startled, you stumble backwards, and the impact of your hitting the ground jolts the skull loose. It
bounces towards you, and you fumble for your sword to fend it off. Deduct 2 from your Attack Strength
during the following fight because of your awkward position.

You place the peculiar, almost see-through helmet on your head. A red haze comes over your senses and
waves of fury flow through you. After a few seconds, the sensations die down till they are still present but
only just noticeable. The Helmet of Fury is powerfully enchanted but comes with some drawbacks. If you
are ever wounded in a fight when fighting a creature that has a higher SKILL than your own, increase
your current SKILL by 1 for as long as the battle lasts. This happens every time you are wounded in a
combat, so long as your opponent's SKILL is still higher than your own and this SKILL increase can take
you above your Initial SKILL. At the end of the battle, any SKILL you gained this way is lost again.
Once you have gained any SKILL points in a combat from the helmet, you cannot choose to Escape from
that battle; you will be too filled with rage to even consider fleeing. The helmet cannot be removed, so
long as you live. Now turn back to the paragraph you came from.

The spider part of the creature (What should you call this thing? A Spake?) bares its poisonous fangs at
you, but is unable to keep you from plunging your sword deep into its body. It shudders and then goes
limp, and you stumble backwards away from it, blundering into the mound of silk-enshrouded cadavers.
A voice calls down from above, asking if you are all right. You are not immediately able to give a
coherent answer, and by the time you have regained your composure, the bosun of the Sea Horse has
climbed down into the hold to find out what is going on. At the sight of the bodies he calls his fellow
sailors down to take the dead men up for a decent burial. This turns out to consist of saying a short prayer
to Hydana and dropping the corpses over the side of the barge to drift down river.
You and the sailors search the hold in case there are any more corpses in it, and find only a large cage,
several of its bars wrenched inwards. It would appear that the creature was being transported along the
river for some reason, and managed to escape and kill everyone on the barge.
The last of the bodies proves unusually heavy, and the bosun cuts through the cocoon of web to find the
cause, a bulging money-pouch, which he cuts from the dead man's belt and casts aside with a superstitious
grimace. You take the pouch for your efforts: it contains 19 Gold Pieces and a Pass to the Battle Pit in

You put on the stilts and after a few wobbles and miss-steps, stumble over to the city walls. The walls
banding the city vary in height and this is one of the lower sections. The stilts get you higher up the wall
where, unlike the plastered wall below, the brickwork has not been finished and there are many handholds
you can use.
Waiting briefly till the guards are out of sight, you reach up and get a hold on the rough stone wall,
kicking off the stilts and scrambling the remaining distance to the top of the wall. Once on the wall you
only have a few moments to act before you are spotted by the returning guards. If you have a Potion of
Climbing and wish to use it, or a Rope and Grappling Hook (which you can retrieve after your climb),
you rapidly climb down the far side of the wall, turn to 263.
Otherwise you have no choice but to lower yourself down the other side of the wall as far as you can, then
drop. Your fall is padded to a degree by dense undergrowth that grows up to this section of the cities wall,
but the distance is still great enough that the fall remains dangerous. Roll 1 die and subtract 1 from the
roll (to give you a number from 0 to 5). This is the amount of STAMINA points you lose from the fall. If
you are unfortunate enough to lose 5 STAMINA points, you lose a further 1 SKILL point as a bone in
your leg cracks upon landing. If you are still alive, turn to 263.

Steering the raft as best you can with a pole, you head for the narrow channel between the ship's hull and
the river bank. So intent are you on manoeuvring through the gap that you pay no attention to the sounds
of activity on the deck of the ship until it is too late. Without warning something large and heavy falls
onto you, knocking you flat. As you struggle to get up again, you realise that you have been caught in a
weighted net. Before you have time to get free, a large rogue has shinned down a rope to the raft, and a
heavy blow to the back of your head renders you unconscious.
You come round to find yourself in a dark, crowded, stinking, stifling hold, half-crushed by the mass of
moaning men jammed in with you, your wrists and ankles in manacles, your equipment stolen. Even if
you survive until you are let out again, you are almost certain to be sold into slavery, and you have no

For two days you trek across the Pagan Plains, seeing few signs of life. Roll one die for each night that
passes on your lonely journey. If you roll 4 or higher, you find a small hut out in the middle of nowhere,
and its occupants will allow you to spend the night there in return for a small sum of money: subtract 3
from the number you rolled, and pay that many Gold Pieces to stay there until daybreak. If you roll 3 or
lower, or cannot (or will not) pay the sum asked, you must spend the night on the plains: deduct one
portion of Provisions.
The third day is similarly uneventful until you reach the bank of the Red River early in the evening. For a
while you head west, keeping an eye out for a spot at which you can cross the river, but without success.
You are about to give up until morning and make camp by a large bush which blocks your way when you
hear lowered voices from the other side of the bush. Wary of approaching strangers who might prove to
be hostile, you crouch down and try to make out what they are saying.
&quot;Are you sure this is the right place?&quot; rasps one voice.
&quot;Course I am,&quot; snaps another. &quot;I recognise that big flat stone there. Now help me with this net, will ye?&quot;
&quot;I don't like the look o' that cloud,&quot; mutters a third. &quot;Don't wanna get caught in the rain.&quot;
The owner of the second voice snorts. &quot;Well, if ye want to go back, we won't stop ye. Mind, we'll have to
hang on to the boat, so ye might get just a bit damp wadin' across to Mirewater.&quot;
He and the first speaker both cackle at this, while the third grumbles, but you don't pay any more attention
to what is being said, as you have heard enough. Mirewater is another Dwarven village; its inhabitants
bitter enemies of the ones in Stonebridge, so you should probably leave this party alone. Still, the boat
they mentioned could be just what you need. Keeping low, you sneak a look along the bank, and spot the
boat tucked away under the bush where it overhangs the river. The noise made by the Dwarves as they
struggle with the net keeps them from hearing whatever rustling you make as you manoeuvre yourself
into the boat and, undoing the mooring rope, you begin to paddle across the river. Add 1 LUCK point for
this good fortune.
By the time you reach the far side, it is too dark for you to go any further, so you settle down for the night.
You must eat a meal. In the morning, you continue south-west towards your destination. Turn to 373.

You defeat the Elemental but the Dark Elf priest has not been idle. While the battle raged, a spell of dark
magic was cast on his dagger. Now, as you start towards him again, he slashes his arm with the dagger,
letting his blood flow over its length before hurling it at you.
You must Test your Skill. If you are successful, you avoid the missile and continue on towards him (turn
to 259). If you are unsuccessful, the blade slashes you, unleashing a powerful heart-stopping magic into
your body. You stumble on a few more steps then collapse on to the ground, where you lay sprawled out,
dead.

You have been walking through the forest for some time when you reach a small clearing. A figure in
dark green robes stands in the middle, facing you, though a hood conceals the stranger's face from sight.
Inclining its head upwards slightly, the figure speaks in a soft voice.
&quot;Greetings, young hero. I am Vitriana of Yore, and I have learned of your quest and come to guide you on
your way. The paths through the forest can be confusing to outsiders.&quot; A thin, wrinkled hand emerges
from the folds of the cloak, holding out a small loaf of bread. &quot;This has medicinal herbs baked into it, to
strengthen you for the ordeals that lie ahead.&quot;
Sensing no malice in the old woman, you step forwards to take the loaf. It counts as one portion of
Provisions, but will heal an extra 2 points of STAMINA when eaten, even if the text states that you gain
no STAMINA for the meal in which you eat it. If you have a large blister on the palm of your hand, turn

Exhausted from the fight, you rest a while, reflecting with sorrow upon what has come of the Barbarian's
desire for solitude. A pouch he dropped when charging into the fight contains 5 Gold Pieces and two
strips of dried meat, which you may take as an extra portion of Provisions.
Once you have recovered your strength, you continue north, encountering nothing larger than insects for
the rest of the day. By nightfall you can hear the sound of the River Kok, beyond which lies Fang. Trying
to cross it in the dark would be foolhardy, so you make camp. After all your exertions you must eat:
deduct one portion of Provisions.
In the morning, you cover the remaining distance to the river in little time. The ferry across costs 2 Gold
Pieces, and minutes later you are outside the city gate. Turn to 131.

You hop into the shadows of the bridge where you believe you will be protected while you consider what
has happened. Unfortunately for you, gangs of young Goblins roam the riverbank looking not only for
cast off goods or materials that have fallen over the side of boats, but also for morsels of food, such as
yourself.
You are quickly spotted by one of these bands and although you give them great sport with your attempts
to flee, you are soon roasting over a spit, a decent meal for one of the hungry Goblin urchins. Your

You slowly walk towards the source of the commotion. Taking cover behind some bushes, you slowly
raise your head up to see what is causing the argument. Three ORCS are gathering around a large crow,
whose wings are crudely bound down with a thin rope. They are arguing over how to cook the crow. One
wants to boil it, another wants to roast it, and the last one wants to eat it raw. Unfortunately, one of the
Orcs was facing in your direction when you took a look. He shouts to his companions and points at you.
They charge forward at you, eager for another meal.

The cave behind the waterfall ends after five metres or so. For a moment you panic, thinking you may
have come all this way just to meet a dead end. But closer inspection uncovers a group of runes on the
back wall which you suspect to be the entrance to the hidden base. You try to decipher what the runes
mean but you cannot make anything of them. You contact Yaztromo.
&quot;Have you found it?&quot; he enquires. You reply that you may have found a magically locked doorway and
that you do not understand what the runes say. &quot;Describe them to me one by one and I'll see what I can
do.&quot;
Within the first few, Yaztromo tells you that the door is locked with Dark Elf magic. In order to open it,
you must recite the spell inscribed on the doorway perfectly; or else it may trigger a trap set within the
magic lock. You describe the runes to Yaztromo while he deciphers their meaning. There is one particular
rune that is slightly smudged, so you have difficulty describing it. Test your Luck. If you are Lucky, turn

You don't waste any time searching the bodies, but you can pick up a poisoned-coated scimitar. It inflicts
the same amount of damage as the dagger you have though you need not make any deductions to your
Attack Strength when using it. You must now get on top of the rock face. The magic imbued ropes the
Dark Elves used to descend refuse to take your weight.

Using the map you begin your long trek through the mines. The marked area on the map is presumably
the part currently being mined and you head towards that. There are a lot of twists and turns and it takes
all your concentration to keep your current position marked with a finger on the map. Fortunately, the
map is very well made and every tunnel and corridor is easy to follow. As you wander through the mines,
you wonder how much gold and gems have been mined from this place, considering the immenseness of
this maze-like cave. After walking for a bit, you reach a tunnel where according to the map you should go
right, and you are just about to do so when you hear a growling echo from the left tunnel. Do you wish to

As you cross the cavern, several of the Dark Elves turn to look at you. One of the Dark Elves calls out to
you but you ignore them; your whole posture and bearing radiating hauteur, your attitude, dismissive. It
seems to work as the Dark Elves go back to their own business giving you the chance to move on.
You don't want to get too close to any of the Dark Elves - you cannot risk conversation since you don't
speak their language. If you want to head towards the unguarded door on the right-hand wall, turn to 375.

You step through the archway into a shrine dedicated to Asrel, goddess of love and beauty. Her loveliness
is brilliantly carved in smooth white marble at the head of an altar on which two incense burners rest.
Exquisite silken drapes hang from the ceiling reflecting the flickering candle light on to the statue. Just
watching the scene relieves you and you kneel before her in prayer.

In the afternoon the river turns south, and Captain Tully tells you that he has brought you as close to your
destination as he can. &quot;Any further, and we'll be taking you further away again. I'm sorry, but you'll have
to go the rest of the way on foot. Still, this must have saved you a few days' travel.&quot;

Your foe lies in fragments, but you cannot rest yet, as there are still many more boulders lining the hills
on both sides of the valley, and any of them might be alive too. You set a brisk pace towards the end of
the valley, but not too fast to be in danger of tripping, or of being unable to stop in time if another
Boulder Beast should come after you.
Roll one die and halve the result (rounding fractions up) and add 1. This is the number of Boulder Beasts
with which you will have to contend before you can get to safety. They attack you one at a time. For each
Boulder Beast, Test your Skill to see if you can dodge its initial rush. If you fail, you do not manage to get
out of the way, and are killed instantly. If you succeed, you avoid being crushed and can then fight it as
normal. Each Boulder Beast has: SKILL 8, STAMINA 11; takes normal damage from blunt weapons but
half damage against all others, and is automatically killed if you hit it with the Dragonstone Sceptre.

If you make it past the second Boulder Beast to attack, you pass a large rock protruding from the ground,
above which the air shimmers slightly, like a heat haze. It crosses your mind that this could be attracting
the Boulder Beasts: certainly, it is not normal to encounter so many in the same area. Still, interfering
with it could cause them all to attack at once, so you decide to leave it alone. A few metres away from the
strange rock is a crushed human skeleton, with a small leather pouch lying close to one outstretched bony
arm, and you grab the pouch as you pass by.
If you make it out of the valley, you rest to take stock of your situation. The pouch you collected contains
thirteen moonstones, which you decide to keep, as they may be worth something. Record the Pouch of
Moonstones on your Adventure Sheet.

King Salamon resumes his position on the throne. &quot;You have earned the gratitude and appreciation of our
city once again, brave warrior,&quot; he says. &quot;Now that Delgar's treachery has been revealed, word will be
sent for our armies' return and I will be able to offer you further assistance in your quest.&quot;
After deliberating with his other advisers, the king summons a band of knights to him: select champions
who have remained behind � Salamon did not leave his city completely defenceless after all! He
commands them to search the locations you suggest for Dark Elf activity.
&quot;I know what you are thinking, but worry not. My riders will not hinder your progress, nor will they be
aiding you directly. Rather, the ploy is creating diversions. Our move against them will be made obvious
so they are more likely to confront our troops. With their attentions taken off you, your quest may
continue at a more discreet level.&quot;
In all future combats against Dark Elves, you may reduce their SKILL by 1 point and make a note that
you have enlisted the aid of the Knights of Salamonis. If you are also considering journeying to
Warpstone next, you are given a message scroll stamped with the royal seal. Should you come across a
detachment of soldiers from Salamonis you could pass on the order to have them called back to the city.
Because of your heroism, Salamon grants you yet another reward. You may take one of the following
items:

Heavy Gauntlets
While these offer you no bonus to your abilities, they are effective enough to be used as blunt weapons in
combat. You need not make any adjustment to your SKILL for being unarmed as long as you wear them.
In the case of being asked whether or not you have a weapon, you may choose either option. Each
gauntlet is encrusted with an emerald and together they are worth 6 Gold Pieces if sold.

Spear of Grace
This magic spear is imbued with a powerful enchantment. At the start of combat, you may have one free
attack against any one opponent. Roll for Attack Strengths as normal. If your total is greater, you succeed
in wounding your opponent for 2 STAMINA points of damage. If not, your opponent parries the blow.
Battle then commences as normal.

Heart of the Hero
This magical pendant, in the shape of a golden heart, has a couple of charges left in it. In any situation
where you are instructed to make a Test against your attributes, you may choose to take the favourable
outcome. For example, if you were to Test your Luck, deduct 1 from your LUCK score as normal and take
the result as being Lucky without having to roll dice. You may have this automatic success up to two
times then the pendant becomes useless.

You make your choice and the king smiles, wishing you well on your quest. The king's blessing fills you
with renewed determination and you may restore one Attribute of your choice to its Initial level.
If you have already encountered the other two lieutenants, contact Yaztromo by turning to 383. If not,
turn to 151.

Your help came at just the right time as the locals would have had a hard time against the guards on their
own. With you on their side, the locals gain the upper hand, laughing and jeering when the defeated
guards turn tail and flee. Even more so when, in their haste to get away, the guards neglect to protect their
lady who runs after them clumsily tripping on her dress more often than not. When they have gone, you
notice a pouch on the floor and pick it up. It is full of gold coins.
By now the raucous has died down and the locals are watching you suspiciously. You decide to ease the
situation by handing the pouch to the leader. His expression remains stern as he takes it from you, but
then breaks into laughter together with his fellows. &quot;Nice of you to show up, stranger,&quot; he says patting
you on the back. &quot;Those pompous fools will think twice about coming back here, and you made us a
decent profit too. But don't think us petty thieves, oh no. We just wanted them off our turf.&quot;
You ask him what the dispute was about.
&quot;They kicked us out of shiny end a long time ago, so we don't let them in here. It's only fair. They like to
barge in sometimes, thinking they can do what they like with all that money. Me and the lads used to
work their mines years ago until they tried to swindle us. But, that's all in the past. Let's put this money to
good use and have drinks all around. What do you say lads?&quot; &quot;Aye!&quot; comes the reply. The leader hands
out the gold to his fellows who head for the nearest tavern. &quot;And the rest is yours, stranger. You earned it.
Why not join us for a drink?&quot;
You accept the remaining 12 Gold Pieces but politely decline his invitation saying that you are needed
elsewhere. However, before you go, you decide it wouldn't hurt to ask if he has seen or heard anything
odd lately.
&quot;Odd? Well there's always Skolar who runs The Green Gem down the road. He hunts beasts and monsters
if you can class that as odd. Maybe he can tell you more about it himself.&quot; You thank him and continue on
your way. Turn to 354.

Salamonis appears even more striking in the day, although you are taken aback not by its grandiose and
ancient design, but more its apparent lack of citizens. Only occasional persons wander the streets on what
you reckoned to be a busy day. The air is quiet and the feeling of unease is tangible. It is as if most of the
city was dead. For hours you knock on doors, scour lanes and intricate alleyways for clues...without
much success. Apart from the city being far larger than what you are used to, there just aren't many locals

There is a bridge over the Kok due east of Zengis, so you head that way to get across the river. It is
getting late by the time you reach the bridge, so you make camp not long after you have crossed it. You
are hungry after this hectic day, and you must eat a meal.
The next day you travel south, and nothing of note happens until early in the evening, when you pass a

night in an inn there, you can get a room and a meal for 3 Gold Pieces (add 2 STAMINA points for a
decent night's sleep). If you cannot afford the price, or would rather save your money, you must again
deduct a portion of Provisions.

with dust you cannot make out what is approaching...until it is upon you. Another Skeleton Warrior is
clawing its way out of the pit, unhampered by the shifting stones, given that it is light on its feet. It grins a
gap-toothed smile at you and comes at you, an antique dagger in each hand. You cannot hope to outrun it
so must fight.

SKELETON WARRIOR                           SKILL 8         STAMINA 6

If you hit the Skeleton Warrior with a blow from a sharp weapon such as a sword, it will only do 1
STAMINA (2 STAMINA if you decide to Test your Luck and are successfully, 0 points if you are
unsuccessful) point of damage. A blunt weapon such as a Warhammer will do normal damage to a
Skeleton Warrior. Each Attack Round, before you roll for you Attack Strength, you must Test your Skill.
If you are successful, you can fight the Skeleton Warrior this round as normal. If you are unsuccessful,
you lose your footing and automatically lose the Attack Round.

silver weapon, you only inflict 1 STAMINA point of damage to the creature on a successful strike (2
points if you successfully Test your Luck; 0 points if you unsuccessfully Test your Luck). If you win this
battle, turn to 220.

Test your Skill until you succeed on two consecutive rolls. Every time you fail, you must deduct 2

perform one action (such as eating a meal or drinking a potion) before each attempt. If you eventually
succeed, you clamber on to a level surface. Turn to 356. If you are unsuccessful after three attempts,

At last, your long trek has brought you to the city of Salamonis. The sun has set and all is virtually silent.
You follow the road leading to the gates at the base of tall stone walls that encircle the city. The gates are
closed but not locked, and there are no guards about. You see turrets dotted along the walls where guards
can observe all who enter and leave, but these too appear devoid of life. Odd that a city stationed within
sight of the ever hostile Trolltooth Pass should have its entrance unguarded.

Ahead of you, avenues of lamp-lit posts illuminate the dark streets and antique buildings. Occasionally,
shadows scurry here and there. In the distance, the royal palace of Salamonis stands silhouetted against
the starry sky like a giant monolith. Do you want to head that way (turn to 328), or explore the streets

You head into the store. Maps cover every surface of the room, including the walls, the counter top and
even a gigantic, painted map on the ceiling, which claims to be an accurate and complete world map.
There is an older woman at the counter who smiles at you as you enter. Behind her, carefully scribing
another map, is a young man who shows a clear family resemblance to the woman.
&quot;Please come in. How can I help you?&quot; the woman asks.
You ask about maps of the local region and she gets the younger man, her son, as you find through
conversation, to bring in maps from the back room. There is one beautifully detailed map of the
Moonstone Hills region. The asking cost of 5 Gold Pieces makes you blanch for a moment.
&quot;It's very accurate,&quot; she states. &quot;Talson went over every hill shown on the map and saw with his own eyes
every feature. He prefers to do all his own cartography. It's a good system, he does the mapping, our son
does the detail work, and I,&quot; she smiles again, &quot;do the selling, but I do sometimes wish he was home more
often.&quot; She sighs and her expression suddenly changes to one of concern. Seeing this, you ask politely
what is bothering her.
&quot;When Talson sent back his last bundle of maps, he did write that there were some strange things
happening in the Warpstone mines. He was considering visiting the mines as part of his mapping
project...&quot; her voice tails off.
If on your travels, you have rescued a mapmaker, turn to 15.
If not, you sympathise but there seems to be nothing you can do to help. Decide if you want to buy the

You head back up the Singing Bridge in an attempt to locate the Noose. You quickly discard the idea of
asking one of the Trollish guardsmen. Even if they were not so seedy looking, the stress of managing the
festive crowd is clearly arousing their anger - several times you see them giving a drunk a blow or an
extra hard push to keep them moving along. You decide to keep an eye out for particularly shady looking
locals who you can bribe to get directions. Some time passes and it is late afternoon when you suddenly
get a stroke of luck.
You observe a canny young pickpocket working the crowd. After extracting a large pouch of coins from a
merchant, he joins a group of his comrades and they head into a nearby shamble of closely connected

You stagger back against the wall weary from battle. Who would have thought it: Commander Loth as
one of the lieutenants? Alerted by the clamour, soldiers arrive with weapons ready and you quickly
explain to them of the commander's treachery. At first they are not convinced, but your search of the body
produces a mark of Chaos on his wrist and a scroll of command with orders from a Dark Elf priest to
eliminate Yaztromo's spy. This you hold on to (note the Scroll of Command on your Adventure Sheet) as
the soldiers announce that they must take you to the royal court.
They frogmarch you all the way to the magnificence of the great throne room where nobles, lords and
ladies have assembled. Archbishop Kalivan, and renowned knights, Sir Drake and Sir Winfeld are
amongst them. At the far end of the court are three seats of splendour; King Salamon taking the middle
throne while the others beside him, normally for the prince and princess, are empty. The king strikes a
regal figure even at a distance. Also present are Grand Counsellor Helmund and Lord Mordin who stand
at either end of the thrones.
You walk down the central carpeted isle and bow before the king as the soldiers explain the incident. You
give your own detailed accounts from when an assassination attempt was made on your life up to your
recent encounter with the commander. The king listens intently and is wise enough to see the truth in your
words and orders off the soldiers keeping watch on you. He is grateful for your service in rooting out the
traitor and offers you the following items: a purse containing 15 Gold Pieces and enough Provisions for 5
meals as well as a sword and lantern if you do not have them. You rise and accept them with thanks.

As you browse the various stalls, a commotion ahead comes to your attention. A gaudily-dressed,
haughty-looking noblewoman, with a retinue of uniformed guards, is being harassed by a band of locals.
The gang seem to be blocking their path intentionally.
&quot;Out of the way, scum!&quot; barks one of the guards. &quot;Your presence alone is an insult to our lady.&quot;
&quot;This is our turf, fancy pants,&quot; the rabble leader retorts. &quot;You got your shiny end. I suggest you get your
pompous faces back there before they get dirty.&quot;
&quot;Our lady goes where she pleases. Now stand aside!&quot;
&quot;Very well, the way onwards is through our legs. I hope you're ready to crawl.&quot; Around him, his fellows
burst into laughter.
Outraged, the guard is about to draw his sword when his lady stops him. &quot;We needn't waste time on these
simple folk, Muirek. Just toss them all a gold coin and send them on their way.&quot;
The commoners are not impressed, however. &quot;You see, lads. We slaved away for them in the mines and
this is the kind of respect we get. One little shiny,&quot; scoffs the leader, &quot;Not even enough to satisfy a
beggar-child.&quot;
The dispute goes on; neither side willing to give way. Eventually, the guards try to push them aside but
the locals stand firm. Push comes to shove and inevitably, a brawl ensues. As yet, you have merely been a
bystander, so you may choose to avoid the fight altogether (turn to 354). If you stay and deal with the

Your journey north past the Flatlands is no more eventful than your trek south to Warpstone was. As
before, it takes you two days to cover this lonely stretch of land, during which you must eat two meals.
On the third morning you reach Trolltooth Pass, and turn west into it, keeping a wary eye on the ruined
watchtowers that could provide cover for attackers. Mid-afternoon you come across signs of a battle, with
a small mound of dead Orcs heaped in the shadow of a broken wall which is all that remains of a derelict
watchtower, and three fresh graves at the other side of the pass. After that you are even more attentive to
your surroundings, and towards evening you become aware of a large group up ahead.
If you have been through Trolltooth Pass before, turn to 320.
Otherwise, you creep closer, making use of all the cover available, and are mildly relieved to find that the
army before you is at least human. Nevertheless, you remain cautious until you learn from overheard
snatches of conversation that these men are from Salamonis, seeking an army of Chaotics.
Stepping out from cover, your hands raised to show that you mean no harm, you announce your presence,
and request to be taken to the commander of these troops. This is Captain Ritter, a tall man with a tattered
red cape. You explain your quest to him, and soon establish that the horde he seeks is not the Dark Elf
army you are trying to find. Nevertheless, the Captain encourages you to join his men until tomorrow, for
added protection from the hostile denizens of the pass. You agree that it would be wise, and spend the
night encamped with the troops. You will have to provide your own food, as the army are starting to run
low on supplies: deduct one portion of Provisions. However, you are assured of a trouble-free night in
their company, and may add 2 STAMINA points for the rest.
The following morning you part company with the troops and resume your westward journey. Turn to

Inside is a large, dim hall. There are roguish characters of all descriptions lounging about the room; in
chairs and tattered couches, leaning against walls or half concealed by smoke coming from the fireplace.
The thieves examine you and clear a path, motioning you forward until you stand before their leader. He
studies you intently. He is a well-built man in his prime who radiates confidence. The thieves close ranks
behind you. You are surrounded.
&quot;Well, what have we here,&quot; he exclaims. &quot;What would a high and mighty adventurer like you want with,
shall we say, less than reputable folk like ourselves?&quot;
The crowd chuckles mirthlessly, moving in closer.

You explain your quest and its importance then ask them if they have any information that might aid you.
&quot;It happens that we might,&quot; says the master thief, &quot;but, it seems I'm going to have to -&quot; The door flies
open interrupting him. A young beggar boy bursts through shouting, &quot;The shipment...down at the
warehouses. They're being attacked by pirates!&quot;
&quot;Follow me!&quot; bellows the master thief. Most of the other thieves quickly grab weapons and follow him
out. If you also want to follow after the master thief, turn to 68.
If you want to take this chance to get out of The Noose, you can sneak away while the thieves are

You unlock the door easily and step inside to be greeted by an old man dressed in priestly robes. He has
obviously been expecting you.
&quot;Thank the gods my associate found you first. Please, take a seat. I have much to tell you.&quot;
He seems friendly enough so you sit down to hear what he has to say. Kalivan, as he calls himself, is
Archbishop of the royal court. His associate, Gregor, is in fact one of Yaztromo's contacts in Salamonis
which explains why he recognised your magic ring. Like you, Kalivan is well aware of the trouble
brewing in Salamonis but there is little he can do to help. Instead he has been snooping around in secret to
find out who is creating the discord that has befallen the city. Helmund, the grand counsellor, is one he
suspects greatly. He has noticed that he has been acting strange on occasions, and is somewhat different
from the way he used to be.
&quot;It was he who reported the sighting of foul hordes amassing in Trolltooth Pass and convinced the king to
send his armies to confront them. The king's champions were the next to depart on another assignment,
leaving only the city guard to protect the palace. In doing so, the city is left as you see it now - miserable
and practically defenceless. Many, including myself, have made other more sensible suggestions but the
grand counsellor is cunning and very manipulative. None of us could match him in a debate. Proof of
trickery is what we require. Help us, warrior. For city and king, the truth must be unveiled.&quot;
You tell him you will do all you can and he clasps your hand.
&quot;Be careful. There may also be another traitor about: someone with authority or perhaps one of the
knights.&quot; Thanking him for his information, you return to the corridor. Turn to 168.

a chair leg. He is standing over the body of a young, wounded child. You rush forward and attack the

you.

If you hit the Skeleton Warrior with a blow from a sharp weapon such as a sword, it will only do 1
STAMINA (2 STAMINA if you decide to Test your Luck and are successfully, 0 points if you are
unsuccessful) point of damage. A blunt weapon such as a Warhammer will do normal damage to a
Skeleton Warrior. At the end of each Attack Round roll one die. If you roll a 1 or a 2, the man has struck
the Skeleton Warrior for 1 STAMINA point of damage in addition to any wounds you may have inflicted.
If you win the battle, you find 2 more Black Pearls in the Skeleton Warrior's remains. The man thanks

Piece and a glass marble. Slightly annoyed at your wasted efforts, you prepare to leave.
&quot;Wait, traveller!&quot; says a voice. You stop and look around, but do not see anyone. You then remember the
bound crow, but surely that couldn't have been where the voice came from? Your suspicions are
confirmed when the crow actually speaks to you again.
&quot;I am Yaztromo's pet crow, Vermithrax,&quot; he says, &quot;and I am grateful that you rescued me from those Orcs.
I could repay you with information about this forest. Is there anything that you would like to know?&quot;
You loosen the rope and tell him that you are searching for a Dark Elf base. He flexes his wings and
begins to squawk excitedly. &quot;You must be the one who Yaztromo told me about! He sent me a few days
ago to search for any clues to the location of the Dark Elves. I did come across one not too long ago. He
walked down some stone steps near the base of a waterfall. If you follow this path directly north, you will
have no difficulty finding it. I followed, and found out that there is really a hidden cave behind it. The
Dark Elf then walked up to the wall, whispered something to it, and a secret doorway appeared. After he
stepped through, I went to investigate it. You could easily recognise the doorway by the faint runes on the
wall. I could not figure out what they said, so you may need Yaztromo to help you with that. I was
returning back to Yaztromo to tell him what I discovered, but as I was taking a quick rest one of those
Orcs grabbed me. Luckily you saved me in time. I will now fly back to Yaztromo to inform him about the
entrance. Good luck!&quot;

You enter a small natural cavern which opens into a much larger one on the far side. There is sound of
arcane chanting and the bitter smell of incense in the air. You move to the entrance of the larger cavern.
Through the stalagmites and the constant haze of dripping water, you can see a circle lit by burning
candles. Within the circle is a cloaked figure kneeling in front of a rune-inscribed portal - the Chaos Gate!
It pulses menacingly and the stuff of pure chaos rolls within, straining against the bonds of reality. You
have made it in time - the ritual is not yet complete.
As you move closer, the kneeling figure senses you and turns. &quot;Kni'a an ak'nar van c'vish dar sv'andar ish

scarred by a lifetime of channelling the power of his dark god. This is the leader of the Dark Elves. You
have only to defeat him and your mission will be successful. As you move purposefully towards him his
eyes narrow then open with astonishment. With a casual wave, he dispels your illusion and you revert
back to your normal appearance.
&quot;A clever deception, human,&quot; he spits as he rises to his feet. &quot;But know that I, Valgan Shar, am master of

The road to the palace may be direct but is much longer than it appears. You are exhausted by the time
you get there. The palace walls are quite remarkable, sparkling dully under the dim hanging lights as
though made from crushed gemstones. Walking up the flight of wide steps to the front door, you are
stopped by two soldiers who lock their pole arms together on your approach.
&quot;What business does an adventurer have in the royal palace at this hour?&quot; one demands.
Your aim to search the palace for a Dark Elf may not be the wisest response and you mention nothing of
it. Instead, you simply state that you wish to speak with Salamon, their king, as you carry an important
message from his ally, the wizard Yaztromo. The guards are not entirely convinced and are about to
dismiss you until you reveal the magic ring specially entrusted to you. At that point, an armoured man
emerges from inside, says a few words to the guards and allows you to enter.

But, that must wait till tomorrow as it is late. Rest for now and I will have everything arranged by

You cross the Red River on the bridge from which Stonebridge takes its name, and then bear east to skirt
around Darkwood Forest. The forest has an evil reputation, and you don't want to get into unnecessary
danger or risk getting lost in it, so taking a detour seems the wisest course of action. Even that proves to

you, yelling and brandishing rough wooden cudgels. You must fight the Wild Hill Men together.

If you defeat them, you smell smoke, and follow it to the Wild Hill Men's camp, just inside the edge of
the forest. You find a length of rope here which you take and a rabbit is roasting on a spit above the fire.
The smell of it makes you realise how hungry you are. As your attackers can have no use for their supper,
you help yourself to it. By the time you have finished, the sun is setting, and you decide against going any

bloodstained sand. You walk up to the edge leaning over the stone railing to get a closer look. The floor is
littered with body parts from man and beast alike. A couple of scavenger dogs scrap over a thigh. There
are four large double doors at either end of the Battle Pit. Who knows what lies behind them. Across from
where you stand, you spot a large throne, presumably for someone of importance.
At the moment, there is no sign of a Dark Elf. As you peer around, you see that the spectators have every
portion of the stands covered. You look eagerly for a seat when someone taps you on the shoulder. It is a
short man holding a scroll. &quot;Scuse me. I was speculat'un if ye fancy join'un the scuffle? We needz hearty
strong unz like ye. Bag o'golds ye gets fer surviv'un.&quot; Will you:

Allow yourself to be entered into the battle (turn to 289)?
Find a place in the high rise to watch the games (turn to 180)?
Snoop around the levels below (turn to 304)?

You tug open the side door ready for action. There is no one within...until, that is, you are pushed from
behind and sent sprawling into the passenger's seat! &quot;Enjoy the ride, human,&quot; mocks the lieutenant,
slamming the door in your face.
The carriage rocks as the horses begin to canter. Contraptions can be heard all around in the enclosure,
resonating behind wooden walls. Feeling claustrophobic, you kick at the doors but find them firmly shut.

Suddenly, a sword blade strikes out from the wall ahead, missing your throat by an inch. A second slashes
across from the side as you leap away instinctively. More blades follow and you try to avoid or parry
them the best you can. You must search for a mechanism or device to escape this death trap...and fast!
Test your Skill adding 1 to the total. If you succeed, you manage to find a hidden lever in the floor,
immobilising the trap before any damage is done. If you fail, roll one die and deduct the value from your
STAMINA. If you are still alive, turn to 344.

In front of you squats a hideous, unnatural creature, surely the product of some diabolical experiment by
an insane sorcerer. It has the body of a Giant Spider, but in place of its front four legs, huge snakes sprout
from its sides. It rears up on its spider legs, and the snakes go for you. You must fight them all at the same
time.

UPPER RIGHT SNAKE                           SKILL 5          STAMINA 2
UPPER LEFT SNAKE                            SKILL 5          STAMINA 2

LOWER LEFT SNAKE                            SKILL 7          STAMINA 8

The two upper snakes are poisonous, and will each do 4 STAMINA damage whenever they hit you
(reduced to 2 if you successfully Test your Luck). You cannot take any antitoxin to counteract the venom,
as there isn't time for you to find it in your backpack.
The two lower snakes are constrictors, and attempt to encircle your legs. If one of them wins an Attack
Round, it inflicts no damage for doing so. However, after that it will begin to tighten its grip,
automatically doing 1 STAMINA damage every round until killed. In addition, it will hamper your
movements, and you must deduct 1 from your Attack Strength until you are rid of it. This penalty will
apply even after the snake is dead: it will take you one Attack Round to extricate yourself from its coils,
during which you cannot harm any of the other snakes, but only defend yourself against them.
If at any point during the battle you have a live constrictor wound around each leg, turn immediately to 91.
If you manage to kill all four snakes, turn to 216.

You are used as a shield against the oncoming beast, but even this doesn't save them. As the beast's body
slams against you, you find yourself somewhat cushioned by the pathetic three behind you. They do not
survive the attack, but you might. Still, it hurts like hell! Lose 5 STAMINA points and 1 SKILL point.
The door fractures under the massive impact and the audience roars with excitement. You pick yourself
up from the sandy floor as the beast shakes its head, recovering from the incident. It looks over its horned
shoulder at you and rises painfully to its feet; a shard of bone is sticking out of its left arm. You move in
to finish the job.

INJURED DRAGON COUSER                       SKILL 9          STAMINA 6

If you kill it, you see that only the large muscle-bound man is left fending for his life over the corpses of
his fallen companions. Needing no invitation, you rush over to help him. While the man is fighting beside
you, you may add 2 to your Attack Strength.

INJURED DRAGON COUSER                       SKILL 10         STAMINA 3

If you win, add 2 LUCK points. The man shakes your hand. &quot;Not bad, young 'un. You might even top my
title one day. I am Garn, a gladiator once. Life is too dull without action. I came back on my own accord.&quot;

You may perform two actions (such as eating a meal or using a potion) while you wait for the next
opponents. Baron Sukumvit gestures and the horn sounds again. A portcullis is opening. Garn turns to
you.
&quot;If I am knocked down, warrior, take my sword and run me through. No pain or death is worth facing in
embarrassment.&quot; He picks up another weapon off the ground in case his broadsword weren't enough.
Have you killed a monster in a certain cage earlier? If so, you will have made a note of it. Turn to 286. If
not, turn to 155.

&quot;You must understand that my information assumes you are quick enough to intercept each of the
lieutenants before they have fulfilled their missions.&quot;
&quot;Of course, you already know about the assassin in Darkwood Forest, otherwise neither you nor the petty
mage Yaztromo would be here. Metaphorically speaking in Yaztromo's case, naturally,&quot; he chuckles
dryly.
&quot;I have heard there is discord in the city of Salamonis. One of the lieutenants is almost certainly making
trouble politically there.&quot;
&quot;Another has been sent to Fang to barter with Baron Sukumvit for a magical weapon that will serve as a
catalyst in the summoning process of the portal. He's a strange one, the Baron, using his wealth and power
for mere entertainment. Little does he realise just how much power he possesses...or how easily it can be
taken away.&quot;
&quot;The lieutenants will no doubt require the use of gold and precious ore to fuel their campaign, and where
better than the city of Warpstone; small in stature but rich in resources. Look to the mines where I'm
certain you will find slaves working for my ambitious kinsmen. It seems like the only occupation you
humans truly excel at.&quot;
Your hand curls into a fist at his mocking words. If you want to attack him, turn to 6. Otherwise, it is time
to leave, turn to 129.

You walk over to the man who, despite the numerous beatings he's received, seems to be in good
condition. He looks up at you weakly and says, &quot;Thank you for rescuing me from that hideous monster.
How on earth that man could control a beast so ferocious is beyond me.&quot;
You ask the man who he is and why he had been captured.
&quot;Well that's a long story, but to keep it simple I was here to make a topographical map of the area, with
special reference to all the mine entrances. They seem to have good maps of the insides of the tunnels,
just not the openings relative position in relation to the countryside. I'm a mapmaker by the way. Anyway,
as I was surveying the area I noticed two strange-looking men standing around one of the entrances. I
guess curiosity got the better of me and I had to find out what was happening. Well as you can probably
guess I was captured, and they wanted to know who I was and what I was doing here. Well I told them the
truth but they didn't believe me. Well there you have it. I'm ever so grateful for your help, and if you're
ever in Zengis, look me up. Now I'm going to get out of here before some of his friends show up.&quot;
You warn the man that the tunnels aren't navigable without a map.
&quot;Nonsense, they didn't even blindfold me when they brought me here. I've drawn maps all my life. I can
easily remember the paths they took.&quot;
With that he disappears down the corridor. You now take a moment to examine to cavern. There is
nothing much here except for the Dark Elf. If you need a sword, you may take his. You also find a leather
pouch containing 3 Gold Pieces and a ring on his finger. It appears once magical but the embedded jewel
is cracked, probably broken during the fight. Still, a jewel's a jewel, and it is worth 5 Gold Pieces. You
leave the chamber and continue through the mines (turn to 314).

Commander Loth accompanies you down a long passageway that gradually narrows and darkens. You are

You clamber down into the crater. The building remains shift and shudder beneath you. You pick your
way slowly and carefully. Test your Skill. If you are successful, turn to 203. If you fail, you misjudge your

You have created quite a dilemma for the king. He knows full well that if you are right, he may be able to
prevent a foul conspiracy against the city. On the other hand, should he be wrong to believe you, he
would be openly disrespecting his grand counsellor not to mention suffering humiliation from his people.
But it is also true that he knows his advisers well and should have no reason to doubt them whereas you
are indeed a stranger. Finally, he concludes that if you are to have your way, it should only be fair if you,
as the grand counsellor suggests, are first proven not to be a threat to the city yourself. Helmund sniggers
when half a dozen soldiers are summoned to surround you whilst another inspects your belongings.
Any of the following items will be regarded as suspicious: a blowpipe; a vial of poison; a poison-coated
weapon; an eldritch rod; and a helmet of fury.

Recognising the colours of the army's flag as belonging to Salamonis, you hand the scroll over to the man
who stands before you. His eyes widen at the sight of the seal, and as he reads the contents of the scroll, a
relieved smile makes his face seem much less forbidding.
Turning to face his troops, he announces that you have brought orders for them to return home, and a
cheer erupts from the mass of men before you.
By now it is late in the day, and Captain Ritter, the leader of the army, decides that they should make
camp for the night here, and set off back to Salamonis tomorrow. He invites you to join them, and you
accept without hesitation.
While the troops know better than to get drunk in hostile territory, there is much celebration and
merry-making over the course of the evening, and you eat and drink well (restore 2 STAMINA points).
As the festivities die down, all but the men on guard duty settle down to sleep.
The night passes uneventfully (add another 2 STAMINA points), and in the morning you bid farewell to
the troops and continue on your way through the pass. Luck is on your side, as you encounter no further
hostile creatures before you emerge onto the vast expanse of the Flatlands and turn south towards
Warpstone (turn to 32).

temple, waiting silently. If you do not own a Gantamaran Calf, the guards run past enabling you to return
to the arena. Turn to 73 immediately.
However, if you do own a Gantamaran Calf, it has been following you and inadvertently leads the guards

parents. Add 1 LUCK point for helping to reunite the family.
You spend the night in the army camp, getting a meal and a good rest (restore 2 STAMINA points). In the

As you run between buildings, you hear whistles blowing. Just as you begin to ascend a hill, you are
tackled by a rogue in a wearing black cowl. He holds a large knife threateningly and its edge drips with
poison. You could knock him unconscious, but first you must pit your reflexes against his to see who is
the faster. You do not want the blade to even nick your flesh.

Fight one Attack Round against the ALLEY ROGUE who has a SKILL score of 8.

If you lose, his blade bites deep. He leaves you to die in your own blood as he robs your twitching body
of everything, including armour and Yaztromo's ring. Allansia is lost.
If you win, your quick reactions and cunning skill prove too much for him to handle. You land a lucky
blow to the side of his head...too lucky. He slumps over and his eyes roll back. Great, now not only are

Your frantic search uncovers a set of tracks in the snow though, rather confusingly, they seem to be going
back on themselves. Of course, Dockside Pier! The Dark Elf was trying to lead you away from it. You
take several short cuts through alleys when you hear a shriek and decide to investigate. A hairy drunkard
lies sprawled in a grubby back street. &quot;You ole tramp! Watch where ya goin!&quot; he yells after a figure
making for the exit. It is the Dark Elf. You pursue the villain with all haste, splashing mud from a pool
into the drunkard's face as you pass. &quot;You swine!&quot; he curses. The Dark Elf is quick but you are able to
match his speed, hounding him right up to a windowless carriage parked on the road by the river. At the

Every person waits eagerly for what may emerge from the archway. Boos begin to emanate as time passes
on. The baron frowns, and then breaks into laughter looking behind him. He was clearly expecting
something but still somehow seems satisfied. He claps twice and slaves begin to filter into the arena. This
audience needs a show and you will not be allowed to leave without providing one. The slaves run across
the pit removing latches you never knew were there. Four trap doors are pulled open, each needing three
men to do so.
Feathered, prehistoric birds, the same height as you, come prancing out. The slaves scream in fear and try
to escape. Not all of them make it. Razor-sharp bills sink into their flesh tearing it away in strips, but even
that is not what you are concerned about. From the other trap doors, quick-paced insects scuttle forth.
These look slightly different from the ones you have encountered but are equally large and vicious.
With Garn fighting beside you, you may tackle the monsters two at a time starting from the top of the list.

passage divides, but he points you down the left path that ends in a large room. He wishes you luck as an
iron door slams shut behind you. You are not alone here. Looking around, you can see an assortment of
armoured men and women seated on long benches staring back. You wonder what you have gotten
yourself into.
&quot;A death worse than the plague,&quot; giggles an old man limping past. &quot;Shame that you will go to waste out
there...food for the wild dogs. You can call me Grey Mugger. Don't ask my real name, and don't tell me

You take a seat. The fellow beside you is trembling. &quot;What? Haven't you seen fear before? I'm no

Sitting opposite you is a large muscular man. &quot;Look elsewhere before I put this fist through your scrawny

A horn bellows out and a man makes announcements to the cheering audience. The door to your room

see them scurry, limp or stride boldly on to the arena floor. The audience boos them. A set of double
doors are pulled open by half a dozen slaves, letting free a trio of large, wingless dragon-like creatures
with long canines and multiple arms. The horn sounds again signalling the start of battle. The beasts
waste no time at all, grabbing hold of the nearby slaves then charging for the nine combatants. The
audience roars with excitement. Frantic howls, screams of agony and bloodthirsty cheers flood the Battle

The ferry across the River Kok is operated by a stout man with short legs, thick arms, and a fondness for
cheap wine, judging by the smell of his breath and the stains on his clothes.
&quot;Costs 2 Gold to cross the river,&quot; he tells you. With a look at the queue behind you, he adds, &quot;Or if you

The effort of rowing across the river will cost you 1 STAMINA point. If you cannot afford to pay your
way, and are in such poor condition that the exertion would kill you, the ferryman offers you food and a
modest share of the takings in return for a day's work at the oars: raise your STAMINA to 4, roll one die,
add 1 to the number rolled and gain that many Gold Pieces. However, this delay will give the Dark Elf
lieutenants a little more time to advance their plans, and you must deduct 2 points from your LUCK to

warrior. It has been a while since I have witnessed such admirable skill in combat. Makes me miss the
thrill of -&quot;
&quot;Don't mean to interrupt, but why have you brought me here?&quot; you ask.
&quot;Of course. Time is precious to an adventurer, so I'll get straight to the point. Nobody was betting on you
today, but many placed bets against you. I can scarcely imagine how much your astounding victory has
cost the gamblers. Nevertheless, the crowd love you; a few more victories will mark you as Champion!
Take this, you have earned it.&quot; He throws you a heavy bag of coins. &quot;There has been a shortage of new
blood around here. Fight for me tomorrow and you will receive twice that.&quot;
&quot;I didn't come for the money,&quot; you tell him sternly. &quot;I am searching for a Dark Elf.&quot;
&quot;Oh, so it's information you're after. Business or personal?&quot;
&quot;For the sake of Allansia.&quot;
&quot;Business then. Well, I'm afraid I can't be of help since I know not where he is. But it's all blood and
money to me anyhow. A Dark Elf came to me with a proposition of trade: the promise of the deadliest
creature known to man in exchange for a mere sword. Thanks to you, the death of the Saw-Tooth proved
him wrong. That'll teach him not to underestimate our species. I took back my agreement, of course, and
he tried to intimidate me with threats. Naturally, I had my guards escort him out but I suspect he will
attempt to obtain the sword by force. It's obviously important somehow so, you might as well have it
since you don't want the money. If the Dark Elves do decide to make a move, I'd rather it be in your hands
than mine. It once belonged to a fabled warrior named Tamahelos. It was rusty when first found, until a
blacksmith managed to restore its original quality. Use it well.&quot; You accept the sword, marvelling its keen
edge and outlandish design. A brilliant red ruby is embedded on to the hilt and to your delight you realise
that the blade is magical. It feels good in your grasp, ringing as you cut arcs in the air. Record the Sword
of Tamahelos on your Adventure Sheet. During combat, the sword will add 1 to your Attack Strength.
&quot;Come back again. Our gates are always open.&quot; Turn to 318.

The shops and peddlers begin to thin out as you reach the end of the street. The afternoon sun is setting

You throw down the statuette and summon the Black Panther. The thieves break, skittering backward as it
roars its defiance and turns on them. You cannot spend the time required to control the Panther but
instead use the opportunity to flee; fortunately your distraction means you are not followed. You quickly

You find no possessions on the body so you search the rest of the room. A grille in the back room looks
curious but the stench of sewage wafts forth and you keep well away. Behind the counter you find 4 Gold
Pieces, a vial of poison, and a bottle of brandy which restores 5 points of STAMINA when you drink it.
You consider browsing upstairs but who knows what other nasty surprises this place may hold?
You leave while you still can and soon find a spacious stable to sleep in. There is a cloak left here which
you can keep as a useful blanket. The horses you share the company with get a little restless at times but
at least they won't try to eat you. Night passes without further incident and you begin your search for a

You have been walking for some hours when you espy another lone figure striding across the plains, to
your east, but heading north like you. The figure makes no threatening moves, but you resolve to stay on
your guard just in case. The two of you gradually draw closer together, and by early afternoon you can
tell that it is a human Barbarian. You call out to him to ask what he is doing.
&quot;I go to Fang!&quot; he yells back. &quot;To fight in the Pits.&quot;
It is the wrong time of year for the annual dungeon challenge, so you are not sure what he could mean.
Nevertheless, you tell the Barbarian that you are headed for Fang as well.
&quot;I travel alone,&quot; he bellows. &quot;Don't come any closer!&quot;

The men from the Sea Horse waste no time once they are aboard the barge, and start to bring it under
their control. In the meantime, you begin to explore. A quick search of the deck and cabins turns up
nothing to indicate what could have happened to the crew, which leaves only the hold to investigate.
Lifting the trapdoor, you see only a rope ladder leading down into darkness. Beside the trapdoor is a
lantern.

You must fight them both together. Each Attack Round, choose which Thug you are going to attack. Roll
your Attack Strength and the Attack Strength of each Thug normally. Compare your Attack Strength
against each Thug, but you can only wound the Thug you have selected. If you have a higher Attack
Strength than the other Thug you have parried his blows but you don't inflict any wound on him. Both

He throws a knife to the ground uttering two syllables. Immediately, the blade begins to hiss, venting
clouds of corrosive vapour that forms a screen between him and yourself. You keep away letting the
clouds disperse, but of the lieutenant there is now no sign. Test your Skill. If you succeed, turn to 285. If

You make good progress, and before midday you reach the mouth of Trolltooth Pass. Situated between
the Moonstone Hills and the Craggen Heights, the pass is the easiest route east towards the Flatlands and
Warpstone. Nevertheless, it is far from safe and as you start to make your way through it, your
nervousness increases at the sight of ruined buildings up ahead, and the occasional partial skeleton strewn
across the ground.
Your tension grows as you head further into the pass, and in a strange way it is almost a relief when the
attack comes. A small army of Hobgoblins comes pouring out of the remnants of a citadel and charges
towards you. Two of the Hobgoblins are riding on the backs of large grey Wolves, and they break away
from the rest of the mob to engage you first.

You find your location on the map that Borak gave you and proceed towards the mines. There are many
different twists and turns here, presumably because the tunnels were dug along the major ores and crystal
formations. There is however nothing left here, so the tunnels were abandoned. You are able to ascertain
your location using the map but you have absolutely no idea where to start looking and after a very long
while of aimless wandering you decide to give up and return to the outside. There are far too many
tunnels and there is no telling which you should enter and you do not have time to check them all. You
can only hope that the people Silek saw were not the ones you are looking for. You decide to look for the
lieutenants somewhere else (turn to 313).

avoid as best you can the gangs of Goblin children who forage by the river for off-cast goods and hunt
small creatures to eat - such as toads.
You locate some warehouses and squeeze your body into the muddy space underneath one. You wait as
the heat of the day passes and night falls, then you squirm your way out again.
The moon is shining strongly and as the moonlight touches your slimy skin you feel a tingling all over
your body. You feel a brief spasm of pain and a momentary disorientation then realise you are back to

your body full of energy. Restore 1 SKILL and 5 STAMINA points. Also restore 2 LUCK points for

You are on Goldoran Strip. Red banners hang across the street, all the way down to the very end of the
block and bazaars line the streets. So crammed is this pathetic display, that you can barely make out the
names of the shops. You can smell pork roasting somewhere. A gruff voice from within the tavern
complains about spilt ale. There are children playing and screaming, merchants calling out as if hosting an
auction, and crowds of all ages swerving in and out. Carts and carriages must move at a dead pace. As
you ascend the hill, a few places attract your attention:

An aroma of stew is emanating from within the Imperial Gar-Goldoran Inn. If you haven't been inside yet,

The form that oozes out of the portal is terrible to behold. Your eyes hurt to view the creature; its body
seems to shift and mutate in ways your mind has trouble comprehending. The creature somehow...despite
having wormed its way through the narrow gate, has a hard carapace around it. There are flexible
tentacles reaching out from within. The creature is restrained from total entry into the cavern by the small
portal, but the creature lashes back and forth almost rhythmically, able to reach even the far side of the
cavern at the apex of its wavelike swaying.
You hear whispers in your mind. Obscene whispers that you cannot, fortunately, understand but which
send your mind recoiling from its vile implications. Unless you are wearing an Eye Scribed Helmet, you
must deduct 1 from your SKILL score due to mental anguish. As you struggle to react, it attacks you
almost lazily.

The hard carapace around the Chaos Incarnate protects it from harm. The only weapon capable of
smashing through this protective layer is the Dragonstone Sceptre, which does its normal damage to the

The Dark Elf slumps to the ground. You quickly drag them off into a shrouded position and search their
body. You quickly determine that the Dark Elf must have been a messenger. At their side is a message
pouch that contains notes written in the Dark Elf script. Useless to you, except...Looking at the
messengers clothes you realise it would make a good disguise. It would cover your features, hiding your
race quite effectively. If you wish to wear the Messenger's Clothes, mark them on your Adventure Sheet.
You retrace your steps back to the Dark Elf outpost. Looking into the cavern, you can see the unguarded
door to your left again and the campfires of the Dark Elves straight ahead. If you possess a Potion of
Invisibility and wish to drink it before dashing towards the door on the left-hand wall, turn to 154. If you
want to move away from your concealed position to try and get to either this doorway or to one of the

You decide to continue on westward. You walk for a while before the path suddenly turns right to the
north. In the treetops, you can faintly hear birds chirping. Your walk so far has been fairly uneventful and
aside from a squirrel and a few rabbits, you haven't seen any wildlife at all. You keep your hand near your

Before long you reach the point at which you noticed the dead man in the ditch, and you are distressed to
see that some scavenging creature has found the body since you passed it, dragging it part of the way onto
the path before making off with the corpse's left arm. You feel that you cannot just leave it life that, and
stoop to push it back into the ditch, to give the unfortunate man at least a little dignity in death. As you do
so, you notice a scrap of parchment caught in the shackle around his right ankle, with what looks like
writing on it. Before returning the body to its resting place you remove the scrap, which turns out to be a
torn corner of a map of north-west Allansia. It shows Warpstone and Salamonis, and the mountain range
between them, and there is a note in what looks like Elvish script by Salamonis.
If you have already investigated that city, you realise that you will gain nothing by returning there (turn to

You keep walking through the tunnels for another half hour until you come to an opening to the outside.
There is a body lying in the tunnel with two arrows sticking out from his back. He has a dagger in one
hand and a pick axe in the other. When you look closer at the dagger, you see that it is covered with some
sort of fluid. Looking out of the opening you see a quarry where many people are digging. There are both
men and Dwarfs among the workers and they are all wearing the same grey shirt and pants. Guards are
standing around the workers, some merely watching but others are lashing out with twin-tailed whips
making the men work harder. These workers are definitely slaves digging something up for their
overlords. You take a closer look at the guards and see the unmistakable pointed ears and dark faces,
leading to the conclusion that these are Dark Elves, perhaps the ones you are looking for. But how do you
want to handle this confrontation. Do you wish to sneak up on the closest guard and take him out before
you deal with the rest (turn to 187), or do you wish to dress up as a slave in the dead man's clothes and
join the workers, hoping for an opening (turn to 83)?

&quot;You must understand that my information assumes you are quick enough to intercept each of the
lieutenants before they have fulfilled their missions.&quot;
&quot;The first lieutenant, Delgar Elanchaeanath, is a master of trickery and disguise. He is the most dangerous
of your foes. If you ever believe you are in the same location as him and wish to unmask him, mention
my name, Ne'vesyt Ne'ves and say I send my regards. We share a little history,&quot; he flashes you a predatory
grin, &quot;so I imagine he will be unable to stop himself reacting in some fashion, thus giving himself away.&quot;
&quot;The representative of the Rovane clan fancies himself a swordsman, so if you can find him you no doubt
will be able to defeat him easily. You are a swordsman yourself are you not?&quot;
&quot;The marksman of clan Uinolon you already know about of course, otherwise neither you nor the petty
mage Yaztromo would be here. Metaphorically speaking in Yaztromo's case, naturally,&quot; he chuckles
dryly.
&quot;Lastly there is Ishenla Physonray. She is a practitioner of a degenerate form of magic and so considers
herself to be a sorceress. Her magic is weak; its underpinning's based on incorrect assumptions and
erroneous logic, unlike my superior magic, which is based on centuries of proven esoteric techniques.
You will have no problems defeating her,&quot; he sniffs disdainfully, &quot;but if you desire some aid I can cast a
spell which will shield you against the worst of her so-called magics. It will require a little of
your...essence...your essential self, to power this spell however.&quot;

Though it is already dark, you do not think it would be safe to settle down for the night this close to Port
Blacksand, and head away from the city for a while before making camp. You must eat a meal.
In the morning, you wake to see a ship moored in an inlet not far away, and remember the sailor you
encountered shortly after arriving in Port Blacksand. Could this be his ship?
You head towards it to find out, and before you are close enough to make out the name, a familiar voice
calls down to you.
&quot;I see you made it out of Blacksand alive, then. Come aboard, my friend.&quot;
It turns out that the sailor is the ship's Captain, and this gives you an idea. As a reward for saving his life,
you ask for him to transport you to the next location you wish to investigate - or at least as close to it as
the Sea Horse can get. While not happy at the thought of losing a few days' business, he agrees, and by
midday the ship is on its way. This is the first time you have ever been out to sea, and you stay up on deck
for hours, enthralled by the sight of the coast going by on one side, while the great expanse of water on
the other barely seems to change.
Tully, the Captain, invites you to dine with him in the evening, and you accept. Over the course of the
meal you explain something of your quest to him, and afterwards he opens a bottle of wine and tells you a
bit about himself. Several voyages ago, he carried a passenger who turned out to have stolen a precious
stone from a primitive temple, and cultists from that temple pursued the Sea Horse to try and retrieve it.
Some of his crew threw the thief and the gem overboard, but a shark devoured them both, and since then
the cultists have been killing off everyone who was aboard the ship, though they show no interest in any
of the crew who joined up more recently. By now, Tully informs you, he is the only survivor of that
fateful voyage.
He sighs, and rises from his seat. &quot;I expect they'll get me in the end. But there's nothing much I can do
about it, so I'll just keep on sailing the seas until my luck runs out. And now I bid you good night.&quot;
Swaying a little on his feet, Tully heads off to his cabin, and you make your way to the berth he has
provided for you. Sleep is slow in coming, as you find yourself wondering about the dangers that still lie
ahead for you. Restore only 1 STAMINA point for the little rest you get.
In the morning the Sea Horse reaches the mouth of the river that will take it on towards your destination.

You travel down the tunnel until you are out of sight of the main cavern. Your way is dimly lit by
phosphorescent fungus that grows on the walls. The tunnel goes downwards for a significant distance.
You are just considering the idea of going back when the tunnel opens out.
Ahead of you is a vast cavern. Dominating the centre of the cavern is a great city lit by thousands of
glowing lights and its majestic beauty strikes you immediately. Its intricate latticework of towers and
spinnerets linked together and reaching into the air makes you gasp with awe. It is only on closer
inspection that you see the darker side, the leering demonic effigies and the dark protrusions that pierce
their way through the beauty of the city like a cancer. You realise you are beholding the Dark Elf city of
Tiranduil Kelthas.
Few humans have ever seen the Dark Elf city and almost none have lived to tell the tale. You have been
blessed by a sight which is equally terrifying and wonderful. Restore your LUCK to its Initial value.
Now you must leave. It is unlikely that the Dark Elves are working such hazardous magic as opening a
Chaos Gate so close to their city and every moment you stay increases the chance that you will be
discovered. You turn and head back into the tunnel, bumping straight into a Dark Elf whose features are
almost completely cloaked by his concealing garb. You both struggle to recover and try to draw your
weapons before the other can strike.

CLOAKED DARK ELF                             SKILL 9          STAMINA 7

Whoever wins the first Attack Round has reacted first, taking advantage of the mutual surprise to strike
the opponent a terrible wound. Double any STAMINA losses in the first round only. After the first Attack
Round, continue the fight as normal. If you win this combat, turn to 311.

You find yourself outside the arena. It is getting late. If you owned a Gantamaran Calf at one stage, it is
now missing. Whether you were thrown out, left on your own accord or could not enter the Battle Pit, you
have no choice but to abandon your search for the Dark Elf...unless you know of another option. He
could be anywhere by now and the snowfall would have covered his tracks. You just hope the Dark Elf
wasn't one of the lieutenants. It is time you moved on. Turn to 46.

You head down river, soon finding a suitable place at which to cross it, and then strike out across the
Pagan Plains towards Fang. You still have a long way to go, and as you continue your lonely trek, you
keep an eye out for anything edible. For each day that passes, roll one die. If you roll 1 or 2, you are able
to find enough to make an adequate meal. Otherwise, you must use one portion of Provisions.
Nothing significant happens for the first two days of this stage of the journey. Towards the end of the
third day you reach a village named Anvil, where you can get a room for the night and a meal for 4 Gold
Pieces: if you pay, you may add 2 STAMINA points for the rest. While in Anvil you may also buy
enough Provisions for 2 meals for 3 Gold Pieces. Towards the end of the fourth day you catch sight of
Fang, but you are too late for the last ferry across the River Kok, and must make camp within sight of
your objective.
The next morning you can take the ferry, which costs 2 Gold Pieces. If you do not have that much money,
the ferryman will let you travel for free if you lend a hand at the oars, but the effort will leave you so
fatigued that you must deduct 1 from your Attack Strength for the next two combats you get into.

You realise that you have found the troops from Salamonis again, and call out a welcome to them. They
greet you cheerfully, reveal that they have not yet found the army of Chaotics they seek, and ask if you
have fared any better in your quest. If you have the Dragonstone Sceptre, you have quite a tale to tell the
men, and recounting your exploits buoys up your spirits as well as encouraging the soldiers (add 1 LUCK
point).
As before, you spend the night encamped with the army. Their supplies are now starting to run low and
you will have to eat one of your own Provisions or go hungry. Nevertheless, there is safety in numbers,

The figure in the reeds is definitely a corpse, clad only in sodden undergarments, its face mutilated
beyond recognition. It has been in the water for some time, and is in a very unpleasant condition by now.
Roll four dice. If the total is higher than your STAMINA, the sight and smell of the bloated cadaver are
too much for you, and you are sick (lose 2 STAMINA points unless that would kill you, in which case
reduce your STAMINA to 1). From the way the face has been carved up, it appears that somebody
wanted to make the body unidentifiable. However, you notice that the dead man's right hand is clenched
into a fist, and wonder if it might contain anything informative. If you want to try and force the hand open,

You quickly find Harend's hut located a good walk from the city. You knock on the door and a loud voice
comes from the other side. &quot;Go away. I have no time for visitors.&quot; You knock again and shout that you
were sent by Skolar. After a moment of silence the door swings open and you see a broad-shouldered man
with long hair and well-trimmed beard. He is clad in furs and around his neck hangs a small whistle. He
looks at you intently before breaking the silence. &quot;So you were sent by my brother. It must be very
important for he knows I prefer my privacy.&quot; You explain that Skolar told you about the beast in the
mountains and that you would like to know where it was going. Harend glares at you suspiciously. &quot;You
must be either very brave or very foolish to look for that creature. I spend my time in the wild hunting
animals for food and sport, but I would never in my right mind try to tackle a thing like that.&quot; You explain
that it is not the creature but its masters that you are after and he gives a small sigh before speaking again.
&quot;I guess that settles it. You are very foolish. If the beast wasn't bad enough, then what do you think its
masters are like. But if you are determined to go through with this foolish quest then I'll show you where
it disappeared into the mountains. From there you are on your own. I have no interest in going in there
after it, and if you have a brain you wouldn't either.&quot; You tell Harend that you are determined to go. He
picks up a spear and heads out the door asking you to follow him. You follow Harend along small paths
through the mountain until he finally points to a cave opening. &quot;That's the cave that you want. I hope that
you get through this safely, but I suppose you need a small miracle for that. Good luck.&quot; With that,
Harend disappears down the mountain paths and out of sight. You climb up to the cave entrance and look
inside. There are many winding tunnels leading in all directions, and it would be very easy to get lost here.

You attempt to take the Dark Elf's sword as a replacement in case you lose your weapons, but a
mysterious aura prevents you from picking it up. The weapon appears to be enchanted so that only Dark
Elves are able to use it. You are, however, able to take his bow. Searching his quiver, you retrieve four
arrows capable of flight. Before a battle starts, you may take a shot at one opponent. If you do, Test your
Skill. If you are successful, the arrow hits for 2 STAMINA points of damage. If you fail, you simply miss
your target. You may only fire one arrow before your enemy reaches you and then you will have to fight
in hand-to-hand combat. Each arrow may only be used once, regardless of if they hit or not.

Ahead, you hear the sound of crashing water. A waterfall soon comes into view, tumbling down into a
gorge and flowing continually west. Suddenly, the ring glows warmly and Yaztromo's ghostly voice
speaks. &quot;You are now almost exactly where I sensed the Dark Elves to be. The entrance to the hidden
base must be hidden somewhere in the vicinity. Look carefully.&quot; The ring goes cold.

The road to the palace may be direct but is much longer than it appears. You are exhausted by the time
you get there. The palace walls are quite remarkable, sparkling dully under the dim hanging lights as
though made from crushed gemstones. Walking up the flight of wide steps to the front door, you are
stopped by two soldiers who lock their pole arms together on your approach.
&quot;What business does an adventurer have in the royal palace at this hour?&quot; one demands.
Your aim to search the palace for a Dark Elf may not be the wisest response and you mention nothing of
it. Instead, you simply state that you wish to speak with Salamon, their king, as you carry an important
message from his ally, the wizard Yaztromo. The guards are not entirely convinced and are about to
dismiss you until you reveal the magic ring specially entrusted to you. At that point, a young man
emerges from inside, says a few words to the guards and allows you to enter. He grips tightly on to your
tunic almost dragging you along a corridor.
&quot;I told them the king was expecting you.&quot;
You shrug his hands off your clothes asking him who he is.
&quot;That's not important. Let's just say the king has so far no idea of your arrival but I do. I recognise that
ring you have and must warn you to watch your back as there have been strange goings on in the palace.
We must...&quot;
&quot;What are you doing, Gregor?&quot; a voice interrupts. &quot;Why aren't you at your duties, and who is this?&quot; An
armoured man approaches regarding the two of you suspiciously.
&quot;Er...Commander Loth. This er...warrior saved me from a band of ruffians earlier. I thought it would be
alright to let the warrior stay the night and perhaps see the king in payment of this debt.&quot;
The commander looks you up and down. &quot;Certainly, the king may even want to meet such a
commendable character. But, that must wait till tomorrow. I will take care of the warrior and I'm sure you
have work to do.&quot;
Grudgingly, the young servant shuffles off. Commander Loth shows you to your quarters on the first floor
after letting you admire the magnificent palace decors on the way. Food is brought to you shortly and the
commander bids you good night. You are ravenous and consume the hearty meal. As you eat, you are
suddenly aware of something in your pocket - a Skeleton Key. When did that get there? Puzzled, you

crammed with scrolls and antique volumes - it obviously belongs to someone of high intellect. Most
intriguing is a complex metal apparatus set up on the desk. You inspect the notes but it would take forever

from the valley where you encountered the Boulder Beasts. Not wishing to have to run that particular
gauntlet again, you make a detour to the east, only to find that you are not the only one to be avoiding the
valley. Two Goblins have also chosen your alternate route, and attack you on sight. One of them trips
over his own feet as he charges towards you, allowing you to fight them one at a time.

you leap over the counter and tackle him to the floor.

&quot;Assault is a serious offence my friend,&quot; the guard speaks, looking directly at you! Many of the inn's
patrons are openly laughing now. &quot;It's a ten Gold Piece fine for disturbing the peace and harming the fine
folk of the city. You had better pay up,&quot; he mutters menacingly. You have been set up and now you are

The house is not hard to find as it is the grandest building in the district and decorated in a way that is
meant to be seen. Still, when you enter you don't get much further than the lobby when you are stopped
by the clerk. He asks you to leave the forms on the desk but you tell him you are not here for work. When
you mention Lady Emathura, he looks at you curiously, silently for a moment before speaking again.
&quot;You're here for a map aren't you?&quot; You nod. He fishes out a cylindrical case which he hands to you. You
reach out to take it but the clerk retains a firm grip on it. &quot;You look the honest sort, stranger. I hope you
know what you are getting yourself into,&quot; he whispers. His grip loosens and you ask him what he means.
&quot;I have worked here for five years and I can tell the difference between a surveyor and an adventurer. The
map you have there leads to the mine of the dark ones. They came just weeks ago and made dealings with
Lord Reinholt. Since then, they were allowed full control of the mines, turning the poor labourers into
slaves. No visitors are allowed in. Those that are will be captured and condemned to slavery themselves. I
presume my lady had this in store for you.&quot; You ask him why he is telling you this. &quot;You look like the
person who might just be able to do something about it. I would try to free the slaves myself if it weren't
for this.&quot; He shows you his left hand...or rather the lack of it. &quot;Lost that years ago in the mines too. There
is a secret crawl way to the side of the mines where the gravel is a lighter shade of grey. It will lead you
into the tunnels without being noticed. Please, you must help them.&quot; The 'dark ones' he refers to may be

With a sinking feeling, you recognise this as the valley where you found the moonstones. You glance
both ways, trying to establish which end is closer, and make a dash for it, hoping to get away before you
attract the attention of any Boulder Beasts, but it is too late. Roll one die, halve the result, and round up
any fractions to find out how many Boulder Beasts come for you before you can get away. As before, you
must Test your Skill to avoid being crushed to death by each one, and if you survive the initial attack, you
can fight it normally. Each Boulder Beast has: SKILL 8, STAMINA 11; takes normal damage from blunt
weapons but half damage against all others, and is automatically killed if you hit it with the Dragonstone
Sceptre.
If you manage to survive this second visit to the valley, add 1 LUCK point and then decide where to go

ahead of you. That was too close, and you look upwards to see if there is someone on the hill, pushing the
boulders. You see nobody, and a moment later you realise that you are looking in the wrong place, as a

Hour follows hour as you trudge southwards, constantly scanning the plain ahead for any sign of life,
whether friendly or hostile. However, in the end it is not your eyes but your ears which alert you to
impending danger, as a familiar-sounding cry from above and to your left chills your blood. Turning to

Birdmen, almost certainly the most dangerous creatures to be found in this part of Allansia.
Several months ago you and Tareg attracted the attention of a few of these vicious predators, and you
found yourself outclassed by them and had to take shelter inside the caravan. You don't know how long
you were in there, listening to them screeching and scrabbling on the roof, dreading that one might find a
weak spot and break in, but it felt as if you aged a year before they finally gave up and flew off again.
Though the memory of that dreadful time brings fear, it also stirs within you rage, a desire to fight, to
shed the blood of these airborne beasts and pay them back for the terror they caused. If there were not so
many of them in the flock, if the fate of Allansia did not depend on your completing your quest, you
might give in to that rage, but you know that there is too much at stake for you to risk such a fight, and
conceal yourself in a nearby clump of bushes until the Birdmen have flown past. Add 1 LUCK point for
avoiding such a dangerous encounter.
If you have been to the village of Coven, turn to 280. Otherwise, nothing else of note happens that day,
and towards dusk you make camp for the night. You must eat a meal.
The following day you are still on edge following your near-encounter with the Birdmen, but the skies
and plains remain clear of beasts and travellers alike. Early in the evening you catch sight of Stonebridge
up ahead.
If you have at least one rune-inscribed tooth in addition to the one that Yaztromo gave you, turn to 355. If
not, the thought of having to tell the Dwarves that you have not yet managed to defeat any of the Dark Elf
lieutenants, of being mocked by Tareg for your failure, is more than you can bear, and you veer off to the
east before making camp for the night. As before, you must eat a meal. The night goes without incident
but your spirits remain low in the morning as you resume your journey (turn to 399).

The roof of the carriage springs open and you start to climb out without hesitation. Yet another blade
flashes from above, catching you off guard. Test your Luck. Deduct 2 from the total rolled if you are
wearing a helmet. If you are Lucky, it glances off your armour. If you are Unlucky, it slips past your
defences wounding you across the eye. Lose 1 point of SKILL. That blow was dealt by the Dark Elf.
&quot;Very resilient,&quot; he sneers. &quot;But I must be going now. Go play with your horses.&quot;

When you arrive at Warpstone the midday sun is high the heat oppressive. The city is little more than a
ball of dust, existing only because of the rich veins of gold and gems in the mountains, which also brings
traders to the city, making it a busy town for one its size.
As you approach the city you notice a few armed guards walking around the perimeter, checking on the
people who arrive. The guards look at you suspiciously but allow you through. The city's buildings are
made of stone and look sturdy, presumably since they have to hold against the occasional sandstorm that
blows all the way from the Desert of Skulls...so you have heard. You linger for a moment deciding what
your next move should be. You may buy Provisions from the peddler here as you survey your
surroundings. Each meal costs 1 Gold Piece.
Most of the city appears residential though the signposts dotted about seem to indicate a wealthier district
and mining areas elsewhere. Two main roads ahead are reserved for visitors and seems as good a place as
any to start searching for Dark Elf activity. Diamond Street leads into the main market area, while Opal
Street is where travellers stable their horses and find accommodations for their stay in the city.

Warily, you gulp it down. Nothing happens, though the aftertaste of iron and vinegar makes you retch.
You wonder what Yaztromo would think of it. As you turn to leave, you catch sight of someone else in
the room. Holding up the lamp, you are met with a dazzling flash of light. Yaztromo himself stands
before you looking as surprised as you are. You ask him what he is doing here and he enquires with the
same words at the exact same time. Only then do you realise that you are talking to a mirror. But how can
this be? Your clothes have become scarlet robes, your hair and beard long and white - you have become
Yaztromo! You start to panic but then the reflection develops a reddish glow and shifts effortlessly while
you stare in amazement. Seconds later, you have reverted back to your original self. You check your face
and belongings to find that they are just as they were. Fascinating! The liquid must be some variant of a
doppelganger potion. Who would want to use it and for what purpose? You don't have time to ponder but
if you have an empty bottle, you can dispense the remainder of the concoction into it to take with you. If
you do, note the Doppelganger Potion on your Adventure Sheet. Extinguishing the light, you go back
outside. Turn to 86.

When you step up to their table, one of them offers you a seat. &quot;You can play if you have two gold pieces
or an item worthy to place a bet with.&quot; If you don't want to or cannot play, you decide to leave the tavern.
Turn to 309.

If you choose to play, place the gold or any item of value in the centre of the table. The first man gambles
two Gold Pieces; the second man gambles a Potion of Climbing. One of the men explains that the person
who scores the highest is the winner and takes everything on the table. All you have to do is roll a die. So,
roll one die for yourself, and then once for each of the two men. Re-roll any equal scores, then note down
the results.
&quot;Wait a minute,&quot; says one. &quot;Now we make a second bet.&quot; They throw in another two Gold Pieces each.
&quot;Match it or scram!&quot; The other man sniggers to himself.
If you can and wish to equal this amount, roll one more die for each gambler beginning with yourself. If
you sacrifice a LUCK point, you may re-roll the die but the new number rolled will be final. Multiply this
second number by ten and add the first to get a final total. If your score is the highest, you win whatever is
on the table. (The potion, if drunk before climbing a wall, gives you an automatic success without needing
to roll dice.) Annoyed by this loss, the men push you away from the table and will not play again. If you
lost or backed out, they laugh at your defeat and take whatever you had bet. They refuse to play again
with losers. You decide you have spent enough time in here and leave the tavern. Turn to 309.

Inside are about two dozen creatures of mixed races: Humans, Elves, Orcs, Goblins and even a few
Dwarves. There are no Dark Elves in sight. The prisoners raise their heads in astonishment as they
suddenly see you before them.

One of the Dwarves looks more alert than the other slaves so you go to him, quickly explaining who you
are and the nature of your quest. He passes back what information he knows in a gruff voice, deepened by
pain and deprivation.
&quot;The Dark Elves' priest, the one in charge, is through the small door near our cells. We know there is
some sort of evil ritual being performed,&quot; he explains, &quot;and it's nearing completion but I don't know what
it's about.&quot;
When you explain how you arrived at the cavern he makes a brave offer.
&quot;Free us from these chains. The Dark Elves outnumber us, damn their souls, but we can provide a
distraction so you can pass deeper into the lair and stop the ritual. With the luck of the gods, some of us
may make it to safety.&quot; There is a rumble of agreement from the other prisoners and you soon work out a
plan.
You start to free the prisoners, using your weapon to shatter their chains if you do not possess a Skeleton
Key. You then pass out any weapons you can spare. Before you have freed all the prisoners, the door to
the slave quarters open and two Dark Elves shout a warning when they see what is going on. You and the
slaves you have freed let out a cry and attack, quickly overwhelming the Dark Elves at the door and then
you dash into the main cavern. You head straight for the small door while the slaves head in all directions,
creating what confusion they can.
Roll two dice. This is the Attack Strength of your motley force. Add 4 to the Attack Strength if you
possess a Skeleton Key, as you were able to free more slaves before being spotted. Add 1 to the Attack
Strength for each weapon you handed out to the slaves. Add a further 3 to the Attack Strength if you have
enlisted the aid of the Knights of Salamonis earlier in your adventure, as there will be less Dark Elves for
your forces to face in the cavern. Finally, if you can add a further 2 points to your Attack Strength by
spending 1 point of LUCK - your plan relies on the favour of the gods of good!
If the final Attack Strength of your force is at least 13, the slaves create enough havoc for you to make it
to the door unnoticed (turn to 394). If the final Attack Strength is less than 13, your allies are quickly
overcome. The attention of the Dark Elves focus on you as you run to the door (turn to 171).

The room erupts into chaos as the patrons try and flee for the door. Many draw weapons and lash out
blindly around them, while the three Skeleton Warriors at the door tirelessly and methodically hack down
anyone within reach. You are caught up in the midst of this brawl. When fighting a Skeleton, if you hit it
with a sharp weapon such as a sword, it will only do 1 STAMINA point of damage (2 STAMINA if you
decide to Test your Luck and are successfully, 0 points if you are unsuccessful). Only blunt weapons such
as a Warhammer will do normal damage to a Skeleton. Bottles smash and furniture is tossed about in
panic as the undead close in. You must fight.

SKELETON WARRIOR                          SKILL 7           STAMINA 6

SKELETON WARRIOR                          SKILL 9           STAMINA 4

Fight the three Skeleton Warriors one at a time. At the start of each Attack Round, roll one die. If you roll
a 1, you are accidentally struck by one of the tavern's patrons in a state of panic and must deduct 1
STAMINA point. If you roll a 6, one of the Skeletons is struck instead � you may choose which one loses
1 STAMINA point. Nothing happens if you roll anything else. If you win, turn to 213.

You are close to the Singing Bridge. You pass by several stalls selling sweet treats to the crowd. If you
want to purchase a treat for yourself, cross of 1 Gold Piece and restore 2 STAMINA points for the food.
Making it to the bridge, it is easy to avoid the attention of the Troll guards given the bustling crowds and
you duck down underneath. The stench is atrocious! Ahead of you is a run-down hut surrounded with
signs saying things like 'Go away' and 'Keep out'. This sounds like Nicodemus's place. You head up to the
door of the hut and knock loudly. You hear muttering and cursing coming from inside. Suddenly the door
is flung open and a wild looking man with a mass of unruly white hair stands before you. &quot;What do you
want? What do you WANT! I'm very busy, go away.&quot; You start to explain your mission and tell him that
you have been sent by the wizard Yaztromo. He cuts you off with a loud, &quot;Can't you hear properly, I told
you to GO AWAY!&quot; He starts to close the door. If you want to keep trying to explain yourself to

You are lead to tall double doors along with ten other members and forced to huddle like cattle. Weapons,
shields and helmets are distributed amongst you by the gatekeeper. Most of these are either broken or
bent; the pieces of armour, frail and unrepaired. You reject every single piece of garbage (unless you are
unarmed, in which case, you pick a rusty spear that lowers your Attack Strength by 1 while you have it).
The double doors slowly creak open letting in a flurry of snow and the sound of a bloodthirsty audience.
The guards usher you out on to the arena before slamming the doors shut behind you. Bracketed torches
have been lit to illuminate the Battle Pit at this hour. Ahead, two dragon-like beasts are devouring the last
of the first party; another lies inert, soaking the sand red from an open jugular. Almost all the warriors
with you lack any real combat discipline. Only a few hang back either through sensibility or cowardice;
the rest charge screaming to attack provoking the great beasts into retaliating immediately. The skirmish
is swift and deadly. Ultimately, the sheer size and savagery of the DRAGON COUSERS throws the
warriors into panic and chaos.
Moments later, they are all killed. Then the cousers turn on your small force, stampeding their way
towards you. Some of the warriors scatter round the arena walls drawing away one of the beasts. You are
left with three who cower behind you fearfully, tugging at your clothes. Heavy paws pound into the dirt
ever closer at a quickening pace. You must fight your way free! Test your Luck. If you are Lucky, turn to

Fortunately for you, your body misses the spike. Lose 3 STAMINA points for the impact, but gain 1
LUCK point for surviving what would have been a fatal result. You spot the wooden ladder that the
hunter uses to get down into the trap to collect his reward. Climbing out, you silently curse the hunter
who could have sealed the unfortunate fate of Allansia. You continue on, being careful of any other traps.

You walk up Diamond Street, taking time to examine some of the stores. If you wish to buy any of the
items on offer, you may do so:

Garlic                                    1 Gold Piece
Lantern                                   2 Gold Pieces
Bone Flute                                3 Gold Pieces
Shield                                    3 Gold Pieces
Sword                                     4 Gold Pieces
Chainmail Armour                          9 Gold Pieces
Plate Mail Armour                         12 Gold Pieces

Garlic will come in handy should you ever need to ward off vampiric creatures. A lantern will light your
way during hours of darkness. The flute is well crafted and the storekeeper demonstrates by playing a
simple melody. The shield gives you no combat advantage but may provide extra cover against certain
hazards. The sword is just a normal sword. Chainmail (and Plate Mail) reduces the STAMINA damage
taken in combat by 1 point, provided that your Attack Strength in that round is no more than 2 (3 for Plate
Mail) below your opponent's. Wearing any type of armour adds 1 to the dice roll whenever you Test your
Skill. When you have finished browsing, you continue up Diamond Street (turn to 294).

The Dwarves of Stonebridge are still maintaining a lookout, and a small reception committee comes
running to meet you as soon as you draw close enough to be recognisable. They bombard you with
questions, and as soon as you reveal that you have had some success, two of them race back to the village
to spread the good news.
By the time you reach Stonebridge, a crowd has gathered in the main square, and Gillibran, the king of
the village, greets you personally before announcing that there will be a celebratory feast in the local
tavern.
Over the course of the evening you eat well and tell of your exploits several times. Throughout the
festivities, Tareg skulks in a corner, glowering into a flask of ale, but it will take more than his
mean-spiritedness to spoil your good mood. Eventually the crowd dissipates, and you are shown to the
best room in the house for a good night's sleep. Add 6 STAMINA points for the hearty meal and the rest.
In the morning the innkeeper hands you a bundle of Dwarf bread to help sustain you as you continue your

A large tunnel has been hollowed out in front of you and you creep in cautiously. You follow a set of
rough-hewn steps downwards until the passage opens into a damp cavern. It is brightly lit by scores of
candles carefully arranged in a circle - the symbol of Chaos! Sitting cross-legged in the centre is the
lieutenant, her eyes focussed on an ethereal visage hanging in midair. Your intrusion disturbs the candles.
As one extinguishes the rest follow in sequence, and the ghostly apparition vanishes in a puff of smoke.
The lieutenant rises slowly, her slender frame exuding malice and corrupt power. For the first time she
addresses you directly, glaring at you with hatred.
&quot;You have caused me much grief, human, but your luck has come to an end. Do you seriously consider
you can prevail against the power of the dark arts? I could obliterate you here and now...but, my master
offers you a choice. Behold the wealth of the mine.&quot;
She demonstrates by snatching up a chunk of rock, using magical energy to crumble the exterior to
present the gold within!
&quot;Yes, human. Solid gold and precious ore there is also. We are surrounded by it, and it will fuel our
campaign of domination. Your skills are impressive, for a human, and we require that in our ranks. Join
us and you will receive your own weight in gold, troops to command and a share of the conquered
territories. What shall it be, human: your own destruction, or a lifetime of wealth and glory?&quot;

The map warns you of a particularly dangerous area up ahead, so you pick a path that will avoid whatever
prompted the mapmaker to mark the valley with a `skull and crossbones'. However, your chosen route
proves to have its own dangers. From a cave mouth high up on a hill emerges a large Ogre, which
brandishes a crude bone club as it charges to the attack.

OGRE                                       SKILL 8          STAMINA 10

If you win, the Ogre's corpse stinks so foully that you decide against searching it or the cave. Faint sounds
from very close by draw your attention to an injured hare writhing on the ground. It appears to have been
trampled by the Ogre, and there is no chance of it surviving, so you break its neck to put it out of its

Quite a long way uphill, you hear wooden flutes, see fire-eaters, and are amazed at the amount of
spectators that have gathered upon the crest and beyond it. Down in the distance to your left, chain-bound
gates have been set up securing the entrance to Fang's infamous dungeon. But most breathtaking of all is
the giant structure to your right: a colossal arena, standing many storeys high. Who knows what is battling
within at this moment? You walk closer towards it. The wind has started to pick up and is colder than
when you first arrived in town. You push your way through crowds of people, passing cages containing
fierce monsters and wild beasts. You safeguard your backpack after spotting a rogue slip a pouch from an
unsuspecting bystander.
Suddenly, someone taps you on the shoulder. A skinny man with frizzy grey hair greets you.
&quot;Hello there. If you care to buy anything from me, please do so now. You won't get another chance later;
I need to eat by sun down.&quot;
He reveals to you leaf-wrapped Battle Bites (1 Gold Piece each) and vials of antitoxin (3 Gold Pieces
each). Battle Bites are nourishing biscuits cut in the shape of the people's favourite arena monsters. Each
restores 3 points of STAMINA when eaten and can substitute for a meal when you need to keep your
strength up. They do not count towards your Provisions limit and are light enough to be classed as a
single item. Antitoxin can be used just before a battle starts, negating the effects of poison or venom
attacks. As the peddler leaves, you catch a glimpse of what looked like a Dark Elf entering the arena!
Could it be...?

You have made it into Port Blacksand. You survey the bustling crowds of people all shouting, drinking
and otherwise celebrating. If you want to buy Provisions here, you may do so at 2 Gold Pieces per meal.
You realise that even if one of the Dark Elf lieutenants is in Blacksand, it is going to be almost impossible
to find them in this mass of people. Even just making your way through the crowded streets is tricky, as
people are constantly getting in each other's way. At one point you swerve to avoid a fat man in ill-fitting
armour, and almost walk straight into a bearded mariner. As you and he both recoil from your
near-collision, a small metal dart flies through the gap between your faces and thuds into the wood of a
window frame. You turn to look in the direction from which the dart came, but there is no way of
identifying the person who fired it in this crowd, so instead you turn your attention to the dart.
&quot;Don't touch it,&quot; warns the seaman. &quot;The poison'll rot the flesh off your fingers in seconds. Good thing
you got in my way, or it might've done for me.&quot;
For a moment you are taken aback. Surely this was an attempt to keep you from tracking down the Dark
Elves.
Your surprise must show on your face, as the sailor goes on, &quot;Oh yes, it was meant for me. It's not the
first time those heathen devils have tried that trick.&quot;
He reaches out and shakes you by the hand. &quot;I must repay you for saving my life, but right now I have
urgent business to attend to. Come to my ship, the Sea Horse, before sundown tomorrow - she's moored
in a cove due south of the river mouth, since harbour fees are so high during the festival - and we can
work something out.&quot;
Without even waiting for you to reply, he dodges around you and weaves his way down the thronged
street. You duck into a nearby alley, out of the way of the crowds, while you consider your next move.
Two ideas for gathering information come to you:

Firstly, you have heard that the reclusive but goodly wizard Nicodemus lives beneath the Singing Bridge
in the centre of Port Blacksand. Nicodemus would almost certainly be aware of any evil plots one of the
lieutenants might be carrying out in the city. If you want to head for the Singing Bridge and Nicodemus,
turn to 5.
Your other idea holds more risk. You have heard that a shadowy and sinister guild of thieves exists in
Port Blacksand. One part of the city, called the Noose, is said to be the centre of their operations. What
better place to find information than the thieves' network in the city? If you want to seek out the Noose
and risk trying to contact the Thieves' Guild for information, turn to 290.

You soon come up to a cage bearing a distinct symbol at its base. Pulling back the cover you find yourself
staring directly into huge round eyes as black as midnight. The thing before you has vast jaws equipped
with piranha-like incisors. It has blemished, rubbery skin pulled taut over a squat and powerful body.
Whatever the creature is, it seems to regard you with equal interest. As you stare, a column of light organs
on its forehead flash rhythmically - perhaps it is trying to communicate. You look away just in case it is
some kind of lure for potential prey. You certainly don't fancy tackling such a monstrous brute. Do you
have any form of poison that you wish to apply? If so, the creature convulses and falls on to a pool of its
own blood. Cross it off your Adventure Sheet and make a note that you have killed the Saw-Tooth.
Whatever the case, you leave immediately before someone catches you. Unfortunately, you blunder
straight into a bunch of armed guards.
&quot;Well, well, well. What have we here? Lost are you?&quot; asks one of them.
&quot;No. The baron requests a routine check up on each of the beasts.&quot; You try to act commandingly, but the
guard is not convinced.
&quot;An inspector, you say? I see no identification, and why in such a hurry to leave? I think you are lost.
Take the fool away!&quot;
You are dragged kicking and screaming down the corridor when a short man holding a scroll comes to
your rescue. &quot;Stop that! Leave that un alone!&quot; The guards obey and walk off. &quot;Pologies, they know
nought more than worm in wet ground.&quot; You ask him who he is.
&quot;Ye should be ask'un who I think ye is.&quot;

you move along the wall towards the fissure. The wall is wet but mostly it is easy going due to the uneven
surface giving plenty of hand and foot holds to work your way along. Some parts are much tougher.
Test your Skill, adding 2 to the number rolled if you don't have a rope and grappling hook. If you are
successful, you make it to the fissure in the wall and worm your way into the slave quarters (turn to 348).
If you are unsuccessful, your foot slips and you fall to the ground, making terrible amounts of noise. Lose

The small thief leads you through the back ways and alleys of the city. You warn him about the
consequences of leading you astray. In a whining voice he claims you are almost there.
As it gets to late afternoon, you make it to what has to be the Noose. There is a collection of run-down,
crowded buildings. The one way you can see leading into the Noose is narrow and you spot movement
from the shadows. As you get nearer to the entrance, still holding the thief close, there are heckles from
around, but not directed at you.
&quot;Looks like you caught a bigger fish than you could fry,&quot; shouts a voice causing a round of laughter. You
get led further into the Noose. There are thieves all around who stop and stare as you pass. Your captured
thief is shaking with fear. He takes you to a nondescript door.
&quot;In here. You can find out what you need to know in here,&quot; the thief whines. He twists from you grasp

There are dozens of stalls, with all sorts of items available for sale. As you wander through, several items
strike your interest.

Rope                                        2 Gold Pieces
Grappling Hook                              3 Gold Pieces
Provisions                                  1 Gold Piece per meal

Holy Water                                  3 Gold Pieces per vial
Silver Dagger                               7 Gold Pieces

Most of these items need no explanation to an adventurer like you. The Grappling Hook is only useful in
conjunction with a Rope, and allows you to fasten the Rope to fixtures well above you. One small stall,
set up by an old, rail-thin priest, sells supplies useful when dealing with the undead. He has two vials of
Holy Water. Each inflicts one die's worth of STAMINA damage automatically to undead creatures such
as skeletons and spirits if you choose to throw it at the start of combat. The Silver Dagger is a poor
weapon; subtract 1 from your Attack Strength when using it, but it can hurt some creatures not harmed by
regular weapons.

As you strike the portal there is a burst of magical energy that flows between your weapon and the portal,
causing your weapon to vibrate violently. The portal sheds magic uncontrollably in all directions, then
explodes with furious lashes of multi-coloured light. You are thrown back to the far side of the cavern.
The Chaos Incarnate bursts outwards and dissolves away, no longer able to manifest on this plane now
that its source of power is destroyed.
You feel a moment of triumph for your success, then there is a huge burst of energy coming from where
the Chaos Gate was located that radiates through the earth, shaking the ground with the force of its

Something doesn't add up. Although Commander Loth claimed he was one of the lieutenants, you found
no item on his person with connection to the location of the Chaos Gate. And didn't Yaztromo say that all
the lieutenants were Dark Elves? An impostor may still be at large within the palace.

If you wish to accuse one of the courtiers of trickery and conspiring against the city, convert the letters in

Just metres above the base of the waterfall, you spot what looks like a set of crude stone steps. You climb
up to them easily enough and find that the path leads behind the cascade to a cave entrance. Each step is
slippery, however, and the path gets progressively narrower. Only a person with incredible dexterity
would be able to descend them safely. You must try. A length of rope to secure yourself with would be
most welcome, and a Potion of Climbing, if drunk, will give you automatic success during both of the
following dice rolls. You advance warily along the steps.

Test your Skill twice, adding 1 to the result each time.

If you fail a Test of Skill but have rope, you slip, gaining a few painful abrasions - lose 2 STAMINA
points. You must then continue rolling dice until you succeed in that particular Test of Skill before you are
able to move on to the next.
If you fail a Test of Skill and don't have a rope, you teeter on the edge then plunge into the water. The fall
itself is short as you were already near the bottom, but the buffeting you receive from the cascade costs
you 2 STAMINA points. If you are still alive, you swim to the bank before the current sweeps you away.
There you may rest and consume Provisions.
Reluctantly, you trace your way back to the top of the stone steps where you must attempt the challenge
all over again from the start.

There is no turning back. You must continue trying until you either succeed or die in the attempt. If you
succeed in the two Tests of Skill, you make it across. Turn to 225.

The soldier looks at you and says, &quot;Alright I'm letting you off with a warning this time, but try not to get

sting then goes away, but it soon turns into a burning feeling. That disappears as well, leaving your mouth
somewhat dry. Lose 1 STAMINA point. It feels like every muscle in your body has just been energised.
You have in your hands a Potion of Adrenaline. You may take the single remaining dose of potion with

Asking about the slaves might not be the best step to take. Instead, you say that you are a surveyor from
Sardath and have come to Warpstone to examine the quarries for rich minerals. You add that since you
are new in town, you are unfamiliar with the area and ask her for directions. She looks at you suspiciously
but seems to buy it.
&quot;You are indeed fortunate to have run into me, stranger, for the quarries you are interested in are none
other than my own.&quot; A few of the guards appear shocked upon hearing this. &quot;Well, they are my husband's,
to be exact. But like he said, what's mine is yours.&quot;
The guards relax though you cannot help but detect something sinister in her words.
&quot;Anyhow, I believe this is what you need,&quot; she reaches for a large scroll and unfurls it before you. &quot;This
is a map of the largest quarry we have. It is very accurate and shows the types of minerals we are mining.
I was down there earlier myself. Follow the signposts and you will get there.&quot;
Your attention is immediately caught by a strange symbol on the map marked by one of the mines. It
looks like an Elven rune similar to the rune on the tooth-piece Yaztromo gave you. Why would she have
such a map? Does she have dealings with the Dark Elves? You ask if she has a map of that particular
mine.
&quot;You have a good eye indeed, for that is one of our richest mines containing ore that many other
settlements prize. I don't have the map with me but if you come by the House of Reinholt later in the day,
it will be ready for you. Just say that Lady Emathura sent you.&quot; She gives you directions and thanking her,
you are about to leave when she continues, &quot;You understand that the map will cost you, of course. Three
gold pieces; this is business after all.&quot;

You enter a small natural cavern which opens into a much larger one on the far side. There is sound of
arcane chanting and the bitter smell of incense in the air. You move to the entrance of the larger cavern.
Through the stalagmites and the constant haze of dripping water, you can see a circle lit by burning

&quot;Perfect, it worked just like I intended,&quot; says the old wizard, slumping down in an old oak chair. &quot;Casting
that spell was quite exhausting, especially since you were carrying so many objects.&quot;
You ask him if anybody else has volunteered to help in the struggle to protect Allansia. &quot;Nobody in the
area is brave enough to risk their life, though if nothing is done they will die anyway. If I were to
accompany you, the Dark Elves would likely sense my magical energy and prepare for us. You have to go
alone. Now I'd set you right myself, but seeing as I am worn out, you'll have to settle for a simple potion.&quot;
He hands you a restorative and you drink it, instantly feeling the effects. Regain 6 lost STAMINA points.
Getting up, he tells you to follow him. Yaztromo leads you to his food storage where you are given a
parcel containing bread, cheeses, fruit and dried meats to replenish your supplies. Add five to your
Provisions. Before you leave, the wizard says to you, &quot;This is the final part of your journey, and likely the
most dangerous. The future of Allansia is in your hands. Good luck.&quot; You nod and head into the depths of
Darkwood Forest with grim determination. Turn to 212.

You continue on your way, and reach the southern bank of the Red River not long before the sun
disappears below the horizon. Rather than risk a crossing in the dark, you make camp by the river. You
must eat a meal.
The next day, Test your Luck. If you are Lucky, turn to 39. If you are Unlucky, turn to 319.
</div>
<div id="391">
                                                     391
It is a bright, sunny day, and it seems strange to think that there could be any danger close by.
Nevertheless, you do your best to stay alert as you head into a long valley between two high,
boulder-strewn hills. Turn to 30.
</div>
<div id="392">
                                                     392
As you continue on your way, you leave Firetop Mountain behind. Early in the afternoon you catch sight
of a small group of Orcs heading towards the mountain. You decide to avoid them and carry on
north-west. Turn to 162.
</div>
<div id="393">
                                                     393
You never make it to safety. The wave of energy surrounds you, shredding you with dozens of deadly
sharp stones. Once the magic has past, little remains of you except for some tattered remnants of your
equipment and scattered, almost unrecognisable fragments of your body. Your adventure ends here.
</div>
<div id="394">
                                                     394
You make it through the door without any problem. You close it behind you and head down the narrow
passageway ahead, leaving the main cavern behind you. The tunnel quickly ends in a small room with a
downward sloping passage leading out on the far side. In the room, you can see a number of alcoves and
engravings on the walls. Next to the far exit is a strange twisted indentation. If you possess a Chaos
Marked Ring and wish to place it into indentation before leaving the room, cross the Chaos Marked Ring
off your Adventure Sheet and turn to 141. If you don't possess the ring or do not wish to leave it behind,
turn to 27.

<div id="395">

As you walk over to the men playing dice they look up and invite you to play, even before you have a
chance to ask them if you may. You ask them what the rules are in the game and they explain that you
each have five dice you roll in secret and look at, and the object is to state that there are a certain amount
of each facing rolled. For example, you may state that there are seven dice that have rolled a five. Then
the next person has to make a higher claim or claim that you are wrong. If he chooses to claim that you
are wrong you all show your dice and if you're right you remove one die from your pool, and if he's right
he removes one. The aim is to be the first person to lose all his dice. Each game costs 1 Gold Piece. Every
time you play a game you must Test your Luck. If you are Lucky, you win 4 Gold Pieces (but remember
that you pay 1 Gold Piece to play). You may play as many times as you like provided you have at least 1
Gold Piece. If you win three straight games, turn to 202.
When you are done playing games you may, if you have not done so before, talk to the bartender (turn to
115), join the man and woman (turn to 43), or talk to the three men in the corner (turn to 26).
Alternatively, you may choose to leave the inn (turn to 261).

<div id="396">
                                                    396
You bear a little to the east as you trek southwards, ever vigilant for any sign of the many hostile
creatures said to infest this region, but aware that this route should save you from having to go through
the even more dangerous Trolltooth Pass. Late on in the afternoon you espy a dark, mist-covered lake up
ahead, and make a detour to avoid it, fearful of what horrors could lurk within its depths.
Towards nightfall you make camp once more. You must eat a meal.
The next day, you continue southwards. If you have a pouch of moonstones, turn to 280. Otherwise, if
you have a map of the Moonstone Hills, turn to 357. If you have neither, turn to 30.
</div>
<div id="397">
                                                    397
You recite the spell, and the runes start to glow. A doorway slides open, and you quickly step through.
You tell Yaztromo that you are in the Dark Elf base. There is no response. Stepping back outside, you
attempt to contact him again. &quot;I fear the dark aura inside the base is too powerful, even for my magic to
penetrate,&quot; he says. &quot;I cannot contact you anymore until you put an end to this vile plot. I'm afraid that in
the final, most dangerous part of your journey yet, you will have to go alone.&quot; Turn to 157.
</div>
<div id="398">
                                                    398
You dodge the men's blows and run into the street. You can see the soldiers coming closer to the inn but
they don't attempt to stop you. You decide not to go back there and instead choose another course of
action (turn to 261). Alas, you did not get to collect your winnings before you escaped so you have lost
the Gold Piece you bet in the last game.
</div>
<div id="399">
                                                    399
Once you have crossed the bridge over the Red River, you bear east to avoid having to go through the
notorious Darkwood Forest. To your relief, whatever evil creatures lurk within it, choose not to come out
and trouble you, and the day passes without incident. Towards sunset you make camp for the night.
Deduct one portion of Provisions.
In the morning, you continue south and ford the Silver River. Your route onwards depends on where you
are heading. If you wish to investigate Salamonis, your path lies south across the Windward Plain (turn to
122). If you want to explore Warpstone, you should head south-east towards Trolltooth Pass (turn to 51).

<div id="400">

You are sitting at a huge banquet table in the middle of Stonebridge. Food of all description is piled up in
front of you and the ale is flowing freely. To your left is Yaztromo and on his far side is another
adventurer, the one who killed Malbordus and shattered the Dragon artefacts. This banquet is in honour of
both you and the other adventurer for completing your respective tasks. Although the other adventurer has
been in Stonebridge for a number of days, you have only just been pronounced well enough to attend a
celebration.
You remember back over the past week. Waking up in pitch-blackness, the weight of stone from the
collapsed cavern all around you, you were completely trapped in a small area with no way out and only
limited amounts of dust-filled air. You fell in and out of consciousness several times before you were
awakened by an unbelievably sweet sound: the sound of digging!
It turns out that the destruction of the Chaos Gate had removed the barrier that had stopped Yaztromo
from contacting you magically. Yaztromo was instantly aware both of your success and of the terrible
predicament you were in. Gathering up dwarven volunteers and their mining gear, Yaztromo led them
into the heart of Darkwood Forest where they spent three days, in between monster attacks, carefully
digging to where you were trapped far underground. Without Yaztromo's magic to pinpoint your trapped
form and the Dwarvish skill at mining, you would have surely perished. As it was, you have lain in rest
for several days, recovering from your terrible ordeal. Yaztromo believes the earthquake destroyed the
Dark Elves forward base and even damaged the Dark Elf city of Tiranduil Kelthas. It will be a long time
before they will be able to menace the surface world again.
You break out of your recollections. The Dwarven king, Gillibran, strides towards you hoisting his
tankard high. &quot;A toast,&quot; he roars, &quot;To the heroes of Stonebridge!&quot; The cry is taken up by all at the table
and you relax back into your chair with the cries of your heroism resounding around you.
