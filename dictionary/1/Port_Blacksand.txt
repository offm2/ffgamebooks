<h4>Port Blacksand</h4>
<p>Port Blacksand is perhaps the city that gets the most attention from Fighting Fantasy writers. It is a city known for its port and for being the home of many thieves, it lies on the west coast of Allansia, and is ruled by Lord Azzur. </p><p>City of Thieves by Ian Livingstone gives us the first and most in-depth portrait of the city, followed by Midnight Rogue that gives us some insight into the city at night. Several other books also briefly include Port Blacksand in their plotlines eg: Temple Of Terror, Shadowmaster. Also, the AFF campaign book Blacksand! re-visits the city in some detail.</p>
