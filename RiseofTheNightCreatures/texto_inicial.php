echo "<p>You recall that night you decided to take a shortcut through the back alley at 3AM
when the street was dead of traffic. You just left your job at Zailee's Bar and you, being
the bartender, finally packed up and started for home. A dark entity slammed into you
and you thought either a mugger wanted your wallet or you were going to be murdered.
Whatever it was it bit deep into your right forearm and drew blood. Your head slammed
into the brick wall and you passed out for a couple of minutes. When you came to your
wallet was still in your back pocket but now there was a nasty bite mark on your arm.
Fearing for the worse you hailed down a cab and went to the nearest hospital. Once in the
ER they stitched you up, asked many questions and even get the police involved. You
couldn't give much detail since it was dark and you couldn't see the face of your
assailant. What damage was done to your arm was indeed like a dog bite and the nurses
were confused as to why you think a mugger would have attacked you.</p>";
echo "<p>  You know it was a human, you're not stupid. It was probably some deranged
lunatic. Either way they sent you home and when you finally plopped on your bed, you
woke up two hours later in a sweat and slight fever. There was a rotten odour coming
from your wound and it has bled through the bandages. You took off the dressing to
examine the marks and noticed that it has stopped bleeding and although delicate to the
touch (hurts like hell) it healed rather quickly. You got up, washed your face and noticed
your eyes were severely bloodshot and your fingernails grew some since your nap. That
day you stayed home and vegged out in front of the TV. When it was time to go to work
all that was left to the wound were the bite marks and a bruise around it. That night you
worked, making your famous cocktails and shooters, and when it was time to leave, you
went back down that dark alley hoping to meet your attacker but there was no one. That
night your fever worsened and in your living room, you felt a pain in your gut that didn't
go away. You thought you should call an ambulance but at that second your fingernails
started to grow longer and hair leaked out of your flesh. Hollering in pain and falling to
the floor, a snout burst through your mouth and ripped your face into two parts. Your
blood spilled all over the carpet and flesh exploded against the wall as the wolf inside you
broke free.</p>";
echo"<p>That night, you transformed into a vicious creature of the twilight.</p>";
