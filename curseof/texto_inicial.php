echo "<p>The rain lashes the windscreen like a wild insane animal. Why you have to go out at this time of
night, you don't know? Your boss rang you twenty minutes ago to take some papers to Blackwood
Manor for Mr Smith to sign, so a sale can go through quickly.</p><br>";
echo "<p>You drive through the rusty iron gates and drive up the gravel driveway. A dark foreboding wood
closes in on you from both sides until you arrive at the house.</p>";
echo"<p>Blackwood Manor towers over you like a malicious giant creature staring at its prey. You get out
of the car, run through the rain and reach the front door stepping in every puddle all the way.</p>";
echo"<p>You knock on the door and wait in the darkness shivering. The door snaps and clicks as locks open

the warmth of the fire where you both sit down.</p><br>";
echo"<p>You take out the papers from your briefcase and hand them to the old man. He ignores them and
stokes the fire with a nearby poker. 'This night reminds of an age past. A time I can never forget.

stares distantly into the dancing flames.</p><br>";
echo "<p>'Although the day itself was quite eventful, it started when my car broke down just outside a small
village quite near here.' He stares at you and gives you a sickly grin. As you look into his eyes
