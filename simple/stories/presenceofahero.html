THE PRESENCE OF A HERO
By
STUART LLOYD
</div>


















<div id="rules">
Two  dice,  a  pencil  and  an  eraser  are  all  you  need  to  embark  on  this  competition adventure, which comes complete with its own elaborate combat system and a score sheet to record your progress. It is up to YOU to decide which routes to follow, which dangers to risk and which foes to fight.
INTRODUCTION


You are about to take the lead roll in an adventure that will make you into a living legend, renowned and respected throughout the world. Before you take part in this quest, you must first determine your own strengths and weaknesses. In this adventure, you can choose to be a warrior with great weapon skills, a thief with an eye to pilfer and finally a choice of two wizards. The two wizards are the black and the white wizard; the black wizard can cast harmful spells like fire etc. whereas the white wizard casts healing spells to add stamina etc.

You use dice to work out your initial scores. On pages 13-14 is an Adventure Sheet, which you may use to record details of your adventure. On it, you will find boxes for recording your SKILL, STAMINA and LUCK scores. You are advised either to record your scores on the Adventure Sheet in pencil or to make photocopies of the sheet for use in future adventures. Full details governing rules can be found in any of the Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks as well as on the Official website: www.fightingfantasy.com.



SKILL, STAMINA AND LUCK

To determine your Initial SKILL, STAMINA, and LUCK scores:

  Roll one die. If you roll a 1-2, your initial skill is 7.  If you roll a 3-4, your initial skill is 8.  If you roll a 5-6, your initial skill is 9.  Put this in the SKILL box on the Adventure Sheet.

  Roll one die. Add 11 to the number.  Put the result in the STAMINA box on the
Adventure Sheet.

  Roll one die. Add 6 to the number and enter this total in the LUCK box.



For reasons that will be explained below, all your scores will change constantly during the adventure. You must keep an accurate record of these scores, and for this reason, you are advised to write small in the boxes or to keep an eraser handy. However, never rub out your Initial scores, except on those very rare occasions when the text specifically tells you so.

Although you may be rewarded additional SKILL, STAMINA and LUCK points, these totals may never exceed your initial Scores, except on very rare occasions, when you will instructed on a particular page. SKILL reflects your general expertise in fighting and combat; the higher the better. STAMINA score reflects your general constitution, your overall will to survive, your determination and overall fitness; the higher your STAMINA score, the longer you will be able to survive. LUCK score indicates how naturally lucky a person you are. Luck - and Magic - are facts of life in the fantasy world you are about to explore.
BATTLES

You will often come across situations in the book where you are instructed to fight a creature of some sort.  An option to flee may be given, but if not - or if you choose to fight the creature anyway - you must resolve the battle as set out below.

First, record the creature's skill and stamina scores in the first vacant encounter box on your adventure sheet. The scores for each creature are given in the book each time you have an encounter.  The sequence of the combat is then:

1.   Roll both dice once for the creature.  Add its skill score.  This total is the creature's attack strength.
2.   Roll both dice once for yourself.  Add the number rolled to your skill score.  This total is your attack strength.
3.   If your attack strength is higher than your opponent, you have wounded it:
proceed to step 4.  If the creature's attack strength is higher than yours, it has
wounded you: proceed to step 5.  If both attack strength totals are the same, you have avoided each other's blows - start the next combat round from step 1, above.
4.   You have wounded the creature, so subtract 2 from its stamina score.  You may use luck to inflict additional damage (see below).  Now proceed to step 6.
5.   The creature has wounded you, so subtract 2 from your own stamina score.
Again, you may use luck at this stage (see below).
6.   Make the appropriate adjustments to the stamina score of either the creature or yourself (and to your luck score if you used luck - see below).
7.   Begin the next attack round by repeating steps 1 to 6.

This sequence continues until the stamina score of either the creature you are fighting or yourself has been reduced to 0 (death).  If you die, you must start your adventure again from the start.

ESCAPING

On some pages you may be given the option of running away from battle should things be going badly for you.  However, if you do run away, the creature automatically gets in one wound on you (subtract 2 stamina points) as you flee.  Such is the price of cowardice. Note that you may use luck on this wound in the normal way (see below).  You may only escape if that option is specifically given to you on the page.
FIGHTING MORE THAN ONE OPPONENT

Sometimes you will have to fight more than a single opponent.  If you are told to take them on one at a time, proceed by fighting them individually in the order in which they are listed.  If you are instructed to fight them all together, at the start of each combat round, you must design which one you are attacking.  Next roll both dice for each of your opponents to determine their individual attack strengths.  Resolve your personal combat against your chosen adversary in the usual way for that combat round.  Then compare your combat strengths for that round with the attack strengths of all your other
opponents.  Any creature with a higher attack strength than yours has scored a hit against
you, and you must subtract 2 points from their stamina.  If you have a higher attack strength than an opponent you haven't chosen to attack then you do not wound it.

LUCK

At various times during your adventure, either in battles or when you find yourself in a situation in which you could either be lucky or unlucky (details are given on the relevant pages), you may call on your luck to make the outcome more favourable.  But beware! Using luck is a risky business and if you are unlucky, the results could be disastrous.

The procedure for using luck is as follows:  roll two dice.  If the number rolled is less than or equal to your current luck score, then you have been lucky and the result will go
in your favour.  If the number rolled is higher than your current luck score, then you have been unlucky and you will be penalized.

The procedure is known as testing your luck.  Each time you test your luck, after you have tested your luck, subtract 1 from your current luck score.  Thus you will realise that the more you rely on luck, the more risky this will become.
USING LUCK IN COMBAT

On certain pages, you will be told to test your luck and will be informed as to the consequences of your being lucky or unlucky.  However, in battles, you have the option of using your luck, either to inflict a more serious wound on a creature you have just wounded or to minimize the effects of a wound a creature has just inflicted on you.

If you have wounded a creature, you may test your luck as described above.  If you are lucky, you have inflicted a severe wound and may subtract an extra 2 points from the creature's stamina score.  However, if you are unlucky, the wound was a mere graze and you must restore 1 point to the creature's stamina score (i.e. instead of scoring the normal
2 points of damage, you have now scored only 1).

If the creature has just wounded you, you may test your luck to try to minimize the wound.  If you are lucky you have managed to avoid the full damage of the blow. Restore 1 point of stamina (i.e. instead of doing 2 points of damage, it has done only 1). If you are lucky, you have received a more serious blow.  Subtract 1 extra stamina point (i.e. instead of doing 2 points of damage, it has done 3).

Remember that you must subtract 1 point from your own luck score each time you test your luck.

TESTING YOUR SKILL

In some situations in the adventure, you may be called upon to test your skill.  The procedure for testing your skill is similar to testing your luck.  Roll two dice.  If the number rolled is equal to or less than your skill score then you have succeeded the test of skill.  If it is higher, you have failed.  Unlike testing your luck, your skill score remains the same after testing your skill.  Do not deduct any skill points after testing your skill.

RESTORING SKILL, STAMINA AND LUCK

Skill

Your skill will not change much during your adventure.  Occasionally, a paragraph may give you instructions to increase or decrease your skill score.  Your skill score can never exceed its initial value unless otherwise stated in the text.

Stamina

Your stamina score will change a lot during your adventure as you battle enemies and undertake arduous task.  As you near your goal, your stamina score may be dangerously low and battles may be particularly risky, so be careful.  Remember also that your stamina score may never exceed its initial value unless you are specifically instructed to otherwise.
Luck

Additions to your luck score are awarded during your adventure after you have been particularly lucky; details are given in the appropriate paragraphs of the book. Remember that as with skill and stamina, your luck score may never exceed its initial value, unless you are specifically instructed otherwise in the paragraph.

SPELLS

You have spent several months studying under the tutelage of one of Allansia's most prestigious wizards, Nicodemus.  You have progressed quickly with your hard work and intelligence, but the road to becoming a mighty wizard is a long one and you have only learnt a handful of minor spells.  You may choose THREE of the six spells below to aid you in your quest.  Every time you cast a spell, it drains 1 stamina point.

You will be prompted by the text when you are able to cast a particular spell.  However, two spells - fire bolt and iron hand - may be cast before combat.  Bear in mind that you may only cast ONE spell before combat.

FEAR:  This spell creates an intense fear in one humanoid or animal.  The affected creature can do nothing but try to flee you for as long as the spell is in effect.

FIRE BOLT:  This spell creates a short blast of intense fire, which you can aim at a creature.  You may use this spell before a combat to deal 1-6 stamina points of damage to one opponent (roll 1 die)

ILLUSION:  This creates one medium sized illusion that can fool intelligent creatures for a short amount of time.

IRONHAND:  This spell may be cast before a combat or when you test your skill.  It will increase your initial and current skill by 1 for the combat or for the skill roll.

OPEN:  This spell will open one locked object such as a door or chest.  It does not open objects that have been locked by powerful magic.

WARD:  This spell creates an invisible shield that protects you from missiles such as arrows or stones for a short amount of time.

EQUIPMENT

You start your adventure with only one item of equipment - that is a small box containing the artefact that you need to deliver to the chosen hero.  You do not have a weapon, but it will be advisable to find one as soon as possible.  If you ever fight unarmed, you must subtract 4 from your attack strength.  You may find other items of equipment during your adventure.

BACKGROUND

'Didn't he die well!'   Yells Hister Brey, Chief Executioner of the infamous Port Blacksand.  The maniac picks up the puffy severed head of his latest victim and tosses it into the hysterical crowd in Executioner's Square.  The rabble of bloodthirsty peasants tosses it from one side of the crowd to another before the head lands at your feet.  The lifeless  eyes  of  what  was  Blacksand's  foremost  dye  merchant  stare  up  at  you.    In response, you roll your own eyes at this macabre New Year's celebration and groan inwardly at the thought of another three days like this one.
A short weasel-like man climbs up on the stage while guards are dragging the podgy body off it and an old washerwoman scrubs the bloodstains off the chopping block.  He unravels a piece of parchment, puts a pair of gold-rimmed spectacles on his nose and starts his speech with an air of self-importance.
'That was one Mister Alamos Thor, a wealthy and illustrious dye merchant who always wanted to get ahead...'
'Well he didn't today!'  Roars Brey.  Boos and hisses assault him from the crowd and in return, he makes a few gestures to them.  The beaurocrat looks irritated at this exchange
and waits impatiently for the noise to die down.
'...in  business.'    He  eventually  finished.    He  then  continued.    'Alamos's  time  was
unfortunately cut short as he did not pay his window tax despite him being helpfully informed of it at the monthly tax collectors' meeting held in the cellar of Lord Azzur's Palace warned quite publicly of the consequences of not paying in the classified list of city deviants, written every month and kept in a secure strongbox in a secret location for safety.  For such a grievous crime, our lord in his infinite kindness has decided to share Alamos's wealth with the poor of Blacksand.  Those that make the backbone of our fine city.'
You start to push your way through the cheering crowd, having no wish to be part of the
events which are about to happen.  You only just get to the edge of the square when the guards start throwing gold pieces into the crowd.   The peasants and beggars start to stampede and brawl over the paltry sum of money.   Screams of pain go up from the crowd, which has become an orgy of flying fists and feet.  You turn your back to this melee and start to walk down Square Street, back home.
The streets are full of people, most of them drunk because of the five-day New Year celebrations.  It is now Fireday, the 24th  day in Locking and so it is the 2nd  day of the drunken festival.   As the drizzle soaks through your cloak, you step over comatose beggars and peasants in the cobbled street.   Eventually you walk down Candle Street. The smell of sewage is stronger here, indicating that you are getting closer.    You have spent nine months in Blacksand and even after all of this time, your stomach still turns at the its smell.  The hot days are unbearable.  Everywhere you go, the smell of raw fish
mixed with excrement and rotting flesh conquers your senses as if to remind you of the triumph of stench and corruption over this City.
Yet you gave up the comfortable life of a noble of Salamonis to be here and you still have not regretted it.  You still remember the day you told your father that you needed to be a
wizard.  Not wanted, needed.  You explained that your intention to study magic was not a whim, but a compulsion, driving you on.   You did not know what, but you knew that eventually, it would lead to ascension.   You remember the rage in your father's face.
'You were betraying the family!  Your lot was to be a knight!  You must lead the troops
of Salamonis!'  He would wave his sword in your face and threaten to finish you if you mentioned it again.  So you did not mention it again.  You packed your backpack and left the city.  You knew exactly where you needed to go and it was not long before you were bribing a gate guard to let you into Port Blacksand.
You did not go to the Sorcerers' guild and you never have.   You laugh at the bizarre building as you walk past it but you do not laugh at its weirdness.  You laugh because despite its powerful members, there is still one sorcerer who has no part in it and he is the one you wanted to learn from.  As you walk down Candle Street, you reminisce about the first time you did so in order to reach the Singing Bridge.  Of all the places in Allansia, this is where your schooling in sorcery would begin.  Under a rickety bridge over a dead, stinking river, there lived one of the greatest Wizards of good that Allansia had ever seen
- Nicodemus.

You had heard the tales of the mage as a youth.  You hard how he slew an evil shaman to prevent the resurrection of three ancient wizards.  You learnt how he narrowly escaped the death spell and you learnt that eventually he had become sick of people asking him for help and so he had retired to a place where only the desperate would seek him out.

You were scared when you first approached the hut.  You had heard rumours that if he took a dislike to you, you would leave his hut as a small furry animal - if you were lucky. However, it did not dissuade you.   You needed to learn his wisdom, so you steeled yourself and knocked on his door.

You remember him flinging to door open, and looking at you with impatience and anger.' Why have you disturbed my afternoon nap?'  He demanded.  However, when he heard what you had to say, his anger turned into interest.  You offered him the medallion of your house.
'Are you really prepared to give it all up for sorcery?'   He asked.   You said that you
were, so the old mage took you in.

Over  the  past  nine  months,  you  have  learnt  the  basics  of  magic  and  you  are  now beginning to learn some more powerful spells.   You also have the job of doing Nicodemus's legwork.

You are now at his door again, clutching the vegetables and fish that he wanted.  The old mage opens the door.  You prepare a meal for the two of you.  While you fry the fish in a pan, the mage looks at you thoughtfully.

'You know my apprentice, our lives change over time.'  He begins.  'As a young man, I felt I had to complete the journey of a hero.  Now I feel my journey is complete, I must point others in the right direction of their own hero's journeys.'
'What has this got to do with me?'  You ask.

'Patience my apprentice.'  Chides Nicodemus.  'Your time will come.  But you must do something important for me tonight.  A young man has grown up here in Port Blacksand. One day, he will save Allansia from a great evil, but he doesn't know it himself yet.  Do not ask me why he was placed here.  The Gods work in mysterious ways.  But last night, I had a dream from Hamaskis.  In my dream, I was wearing my red robes and hat of ritual and he told me to deliver an Elvish artefact in my possession to this man.  I need you to do it.'

Nicodemus pulls out a small intricate box and hands it to you.   You pull the lid, but cannot open it.

'Only the one it was intended for can open it.  His name is Syleron Maris and he works at the Valentis Bane inn as a barman.  He will do something of great import one day and he must have this Elvish made artefact tonight.'

'Of course I will deliver it.'  You reply. 'Maybe this is my own hero's journey.'

'Maybe it is.'  Replies the old wizard.  'Now off you go.'

'What?  I haven't armed myself.  I haven't even eaten yet.'

'No  time  for  that!    Just  get  the  box  to  Syleron.    It  shouldn't  be  that  hard  for  an enterprising apprentice such as yourself!'

Nicodemus is standing up now and shoving you out of the front door.  He has a lot of strength for such an old man.  As soon as you are outside in the cold and the rain, he slams to door shut in your face.

NOW TURN OVER
</div>
<div id="1">

You sigh in frustration.  Sometimes that man can be impossible!  Of all the inns in Port Blacksand, the Valentis Bane inn is the nastiest, most disgusting and dangerous.   The existence of such a place is an achievement in depravity.  And Nicodemus expects you to stroll in there unarmed and give an ornate box to a man who you can't even identify.
You start to climb the rickety wooden stairs and walk along the Singing Bridge and turn into Harbour Street.   The light is fading now and the rain is falling heavily.   Despite being soaked through, you are glad that the weather is cold is wet.  The cold suppresses the constant stench of the filth and excrement that festers in the cobbled streets and the rain washes it away into the sewers.   You then turn right into Stable Street and stroll through the streets.  Two robed and hooded figures are having a vicious knife fight in the street and you give them a wide berth, just like the other Blacksanders who a scurrying by, desperate to get inside, away from the cold, rain and danger.  People are out as the New Year market is open and the traders are selling their wares to revellers in the market square.  You have always wondered how people can celebrate in a city where the hearts of its rulers are as cold and dangerous as its tempestuous weather.
As you turn into Weaver Street, you are blasted by the gale blowing in from the sea.  You
hurry to get into Cloth-cutters' Square, away to shelter behind a building.  You are too slow and something brown and wet blows into your face.  You run into the square and spit it out down the well.  Disgusting!  After removing the disgusting smear from your face, you take stock of your surroundings.  The square has two inns in it; the Eye of the Needle Tavern and the Valentis Bane Inn.   There are a few people in the square.   A couple of beggars stare at you as they sit by the Eye of the Needle Tavern.   You remember that you are always being watched in Port Blacksand.   Nothing escapes the Thieves'' guild in this city.   There is also an unconscious man lying around the well, snoring in a drunken stupor.  You steel yourself and walk towards the ramshackle den of cutthroats known as the Valentis Bane Inn.  As you do, there is a crash and a shower of glass as a man is flies through the window and lands with a thud at your feet.   He is dressed in a ragged sailor's uniform and he is covered in cuts and bruises.  He drunkenly picks himself up and glares at you through his one good eye.  He even makes his eye patch seem menacing.  'What yoo looking at skunk?'  He yells.  Before you can answer, he runs into the inn, screaming for blood.  You sigh and follow him.  Turn to 47.

Behind the next stall is a young man selling weapons and small items of equipment.  You may buy the following things.  If you do, deduct the amount of gold you have paid.

Item
Price
Dagger
2 gold pieces
Jar of salve
4 gold pieces
Small stone figurine
5 gold pieces
Rope and grapple
7 gold pieces
Lantern

If you bought anything, turn to 38.  If not, turn to 4.

You leap over the bar and land heavily.  You see a pouch on the floor, which you quickly grab, stuff in your tunic.  You then run through the door into the pub's storeroom.  You quickly look inside the pouch and find 2 gold pieces (add 2 gold pieces to your adventure sheet).  See a small door in the back of the room.  You try the handle, but it is locked!  If you can, you can cast the open spell (turn to 35) or you can try to force the door (turn to
42) or go back over the bar and try to escape through the front door (turn to 25)
</div>
<div id="4">

There is nothing more that interests you in the market.  You may have come across a clue as to which street Syleron is in.  If you think you know, convert the name of the street (just the name; do not include the word 'street') into a number using the code A = 1, B =
2, C = 3 etc. and turn to that paragraph.  If the first word is not the name of the street, you have guessed incorrectly.  If you do not know which street Syleron is on, you go to a location that you haven't been yet.  You may either ask Nicodemus for help (turn to 19), go to Syleron's barge on Herring Wharf (turn to 29) or investigate the Dragon's tooth inn, near the market (turn to 39).
</div>
<div id="5">

You cast the spell (lose 1 stamina point) just as the arrow is loosed off.  It stops, inches from your chest.  The cat-man, looks surprised as you look up and smile at him.  Then you hear a shout.  'City watch!  Halt!'  Half a dozen armoured guards are running down Clog Street towards you, waving their spears.  The cat-man nimbly climbs up the wall of a house by digging his claws in the wooden walls.  You have to run for your life, so you sprint towards the docks.  Turn to 17.
</div>
<div id="6">

As you light the lantern, you hear some squeaks of alarm and see rats scurry into the cracks in the barge.  You perform a quick search, mindful that you could attract the attention of the city watch.  You find a journal lying on a desk, which you quickly scan. One entry is interesting.  It appears that Syleron owns a large house in Clock Street. There is a drawer in the desk, which you try, but it is locked.  If you know the open spell and wish to use it, turn to 27.  If not, you may go to Clock Street now to find Syleron (turn to 44), report to Nicodemus (turn to 19) or see if the market has anything useful (turn to 9).
</div>
<div id="7">
7
You raise your fists to fight to pirate who is armed with a cutlass.  He is badly wounded from all the brawling but you can see that all he wants in blood.

WOUNDED PIRATE SKILL 5 STAMINA 2

If you win, turn to 33.
</div>
<div id="8">

You cast the spell (lose 1 stamina point) and point at the dog.  It whimpers and slinks off with its tail between its legs.  Turn to 32.
</div>
<div id="9">
9
Despite it being late in the evening, the market is well lit and busy to celebrate the five- day New Year holiday.  Snow has started to fall and settle like a white dust.  You browse the market stalls.  The first one you come across is a tent with a sign that reads 'Madame Star, clairvoyant.'  If you enter it, turn to 21.  If you carry on, turn to 45.
</div>
<div id="10">
10
There is a moment of stunned silence as the thug falls to the floor and then the entire inn erupts into a huge riot with fists, feet and furniture flying everywhere.  You need to get out of here quick!  Will you try to fight your way out of the front door (turn to 25)?  Or try to escape through the back door (turn to 3)?
</div>
<div id="11">
11
You mumble the words of the spell (lose 1 stamina point) and point at Halim.  You demand that you should have the key to Syleron's room.  The now cowering landlord acquiesces and hands over the key.  'Just leave me alone!' he begs.  You run up the stairs and open the door to room 23.  The room is a mess.  Clothes and papers litter the floor. On piece of paper shows a map of Port Blacksand.  You notice a cross on a house in Clock Street.  You leave the tavern.  If you wish to head to Clock Street straight away, turn to 44.  You could also report your mission to Nicodemus (turn to 19).  Otherwise, you could investigate the market.  Turn to 9.
</div>
<div id="12">
12
Apart from seeing a man kick a body down the bank and into the river, you get back to
the Singing Bridge without incident.  Snow has now started to fall and the streets are now covered in a thin white layer.  You could cross the bridge and head towards the market square (turn to 9), descend the stairs to report your adventures to Nicodemus (turn to 19), Head out to Herring Wharf to search Syleron's boat (turn to 29) or investigate the Dragon's Tooth Tavern (turn to 39)
</div>
<div id="13">
13
You pay her (deduct 2 gold pieces from your adventure sheet).  She looks into her crystal ball and looks into her crystal ball, making a gurgling sound.  Her eyes roll up into her sockets and she seems to go into a trance.  In a slow, laborious voice, she tells you that you seek a man with a mystery that only he can unlock.  She tells you that she can see a green cat chasing the man, intending to kill him.  I see a large house in a street with a clock in it.  She comes out of her trance.  Madame Star is shaking with fear.  'Beware the cat!'  She says.  'Now go!'  You leave the tent, shocked and bemused by her predictions. Turn to 45.
</div>
<div id="14">
14
Quick as a flash, you put the box in the man's hand.  Unlike the first time you met him, Syleron is being quite friendly.  He opens the box, pulls out a beautiful bejewelled silver dagger, and offers it to you!  'What?'  You ask, bemused.  This is yours!  'No.'  counters Syleron.  'You must take it.  This letter will explain.'  Syleron gives you the silver dagger. As you touch it, you feel the tingle of powerful magic.  Add the silver dagger to your adventure sheet.  It will add 1 to your attack strength in all combats.  It also has other powers, which you will discover later.  Syleron then pulls out a piece of parchment from the box.  Before he can give it to you, there is a smash as the cat-man with green hair crashes through the window.  He strikes Syleron in the face with a clawed hand.  Syleron falls to the floor in a heap.  In the cat man's other hand is a small crossbow, which he points at you.  A vicious barb is at the end of the bolt.  If you know the ward spell, turn to
46.  If not, turn to 18.
</div>
<div id="15">
15
You invoke the power of the spell (lose 1 stamina point) and point at the thug.  The thug's expression turns instantly from one of aggression to one of terror.  He turns to flee you and runs straight into a huge bald tattooed pirate, who throws him to the floor.  The entire inn erupts into a huge riot with fists, feet and furniture flying everywhere.  You need to get out of here quick!  Will you try to fight your way out of the front door (turn to
25)?  Or try to escape through the back door (turn to 3)?
</div>
<div id="16">
16
You rush to help Syleron.  He is still alive, but he was knocked unconscious by the cat man.  Eventually, he comes round and speaks.  'Thank you my friend.  I was warned about him, but I didn't think that he would find me here.'
'What is it?' You ask.
'It's a crossbreed; an experiment of the priests of the Demon Princes.  Nicodemus has a great many enemies who will sink to any depths to stop him.'
 If you have a silver dagger, turn to 50.  If not, read on.  Syleron continues 'Now don't you have something for me?'  You pull out the box and offer it to the man who takes it
with a smile.  You wonder why he has become so friendly since your last meeting in the
Valentis Bane inn.  He opens the box, pulls out a beautiful bejewelled silver dagger, and
offers it to you!  'What?'  You ask, bemused.  This is yours!  'No.'  counters Syleron.
'You must take it.  This letter will explain.'  Syleron gives you the silver dagger.  As you

Eventually, you hear some grumbling and heavy footfalls and the door flies open.  'What is it?'  Asks Nicodemus, angrily.  Before you can get a word out, he continues.  'You haven't done it yet, have you?'
'But...'
'Stop disturbing me every time you suffer some setback.  I don't have time for this.'
'I...'
'I don't have time to hold your hand and listen to your whimpering any more!  Get out

You stand in the street for a few minutes, planning your next move.  Where has the man gone?  Who did he think you were?  Why is he avoiding you?  Your reverie is disturbed as you notice that someone is standing near you and staring.  You look at him.  He is not a beggar, but he is dressed in a leather jerkin.  His face is not human, but has feline features.  Green hair sprouts from this mans head and hands.  You then notice that this strange green man is holding a bow.

A door slams and the hands let go of you.  There are two burley men standing in front of you.  One puts his finger to his lips signalling that you should be silent.  The other one peaks through the window.  After a few tense minutes, he turns around.  'The guards have gone.'  He says.  The other one starts to talk.  'I'm Gladris and this is my brother Hadris.  We have a friend in common - Nicodemus.  We act as his eyes and ears and tonight, he asked us to dedicate those eyes and ears to you.  Which is fortunate for you, my friend.  What happened back there?'  You tell the story of your encounters at the
Valentis Bane Inn.  Gladris and Hadris listen with concern.  Hadris pipes up.  'We do not know who this green cat fellow is, but the man at the bar was Syleron.  He keeps a low profile, but we know two places where he could be found.  Syleron came into Blacksand in a small barge a fortnight ago.  The barge is called 'The Gandalf.'  It is moored on Herring Wharf.  He has also been staying at the Dragon's Tooth inn in the Noose.  Good luck, my friend.'  The brothers offer you two gifts.  One is a pouch containing 5 gold pieces (add 5 gold pieces to your adventure sheet).  Another is a jar of salve, which they say you should rub onto your wounds (restore 4 stamina points).

Flagons and plates fly across the room as you push your self towards the bar. A parrot flies into your face, squawking hysterically and you bat it away.  Finally, you force your way to the bar where you see a sullen man cleaning a flagon.  He is smartly dressed in a green tunic and has short dark hair.   He has a look a melancholy and thoughtfulness in stark contrast to the violent, mindless glee of the scurvy patrons.  You walk up to the bar and call out to him.  The man takes one look at you, drops the flagon in panic and runs through the back door before you can even say a word.  You hastily turn to follow him and knock over a flagon of watery bilge that passes for ale in this place.  It splashes all over a thug standing next to you.  He glares at you 'You spilt me drink, you turd!'   He yells and punches you in the face, sending you flying.   Lose 1 stamina point.  'Come on then!'  Yells the thug.

You read the parchment.  It is a letter from Nicodemus!  It reads:

My dear apprentice,

I hope one day you will forgive me for my deception, but I had to make sure you were ready. You see, the hero's journey involves many tribulations and sacrifices.  If you are reading this however, you are worthy to begin yours.  The aim of this mission was not to start Syleron on his hero's journey but for you to begin yours.  Syleron is a good friend of mine and agreed to be part of my little ruse.  He is on his own journey; one that does not involve the dagger you hold.  It is a powerful weapon, forged by the elves,  against demons who seek to destroy  this world.  Since the moment I met you, I knew that you
were the person who would wield this dagger against the Night Demon Shakor.  Yes! One day, you will save Allansia against a Demon Prince.  That is a long time coming though.  However, even the longest journey starts with a small first step and you have made yours tonight.  Now I have some bad news.  You cannot return to my hut.  In fact, you must leave Port Blacksand tonight and head towards the Moonstone Hills by foot. This is how your journey must go.  Do not fear that you know very little magic. Ultimately, what will make you a hero will be your actions.  And those on a hero's journey are always given the means to complete it.  Syleron will escort you to the gate and deal with the unsavoury sorts that guard it.  We will meet again, but not any time soon.  Good luck!

Nicodemus

You look up from the letter.  Syleron is smiling.  'Well done!'  He says.  'You have a great burden to bear, but I am sure you will be up to the task.  I can offer a little assistance to get you started.'  He disappears into the back room for a few seconds and comes back, holding a change of clothes and a large leather backpack filled with dried meat, vittles and a waterskin.  He also gives you a pouch full of gold pieces and several
jars of healing salve.  'These will aid you in your trek.'  He says.  'Now let us get you out
of this hell-hole.'
Syleron escorts you to the Main Gate and, after a heated discussion with the black clad
guard, tells you that you are free to go.  You leave it in high spirits, ready to face the trials that will make you the hero who saves Allansia.
