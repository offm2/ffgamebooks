 The Curse of Blackwood Manor

Two dice, a pencil and an eraser are all you need to embark on this adventure, which comes
complete with its own elaborate combat system and a score sheet to record your progress. It is up to YOU
to decide which routes to follow, which dangers to risk and which foes to fight.

                                      INTRODUCTION

Before you take part in this quest, you must first determine your own strengths and weaknesses. You
use dice to work out your initial SKILL, STAMINA, and LUCK scores. On page 7 is an Adventure
Sheet, which you may use to record details of your adventure. On it, you will find boxes for recording your
SKILL, STAMINA and LUCK scores. Write your scores on the AdventureSheet in pencil so you can erase
previous scores when you start again. You may make photocopies of the sheet for use in future adventures.

You use dice to work out your initial scores on an Adventure Sheet, which you may use to record
details of your adventure. On it, you will find boxes for recording your SKILL, STAMINA and
LUCK scores. You are advised either to record your scores on the Adventure Sheet in pencil or to
make photocopies of the sheet for use in future adventures. Full details governing rules can be
found in any of the Fighting Fantasy Gamebooks as well as on the Official website:
www.fightingfantasy.com.


                                    SKILL, STAMINA, LUCK

To determine your initial SKILL, STAMINA, and LUCK scores:

     SKILL Roll one die. Add 6 to the number and enter this total in the SKILL box

     STAMINA Roll two dice. Add 12 to the number, box on the Adventure Sheet.

     LUCK Roll one die. Add 6 to the number and enter this total in the LUCK box.


For reasons that will be explained below, all your scores will change constantly during the
adventure. You must keep an accurate record of these scores, and for this reason, you are advised to write
small in the boxes or to keep an eraser handy. However, never rub out your initial scores, except on
those very rare occasions when the text specifically tells you so.

Although you may be rewarded additional SKILL, STAMINA and LUCK points, these totals may
never exceed your initial Scores, except on very rare occasions, when you will instructed on a
particular page. SKILL reflects your general expertise in fighting and combat; the higher the better.
STAMINA score reflects your general constitution, your overall will to survive, your determination
and overall fitness; the higher your STAMINA score, the longer you will be able to survive. LUCK
score indicates how naturally lucky a person you are. Luck are facts of life in the fantasy world you
are about to explore.




                                                   4


                                              BATTLES

During your adventure, you will often come across pages in the book, which instruct you to fight a
creature or human.

First, record the opponent's SKILL and STAMINA scores in the first empty Encounter box on your
Adventure Sheet. The scores for each opponent or creature are given in the book each time you
have an encounter. You should also make a note of any special abilities or instructions, which are unique
to that particular opponent.

The sequence of combat is then:

1.Roll two dice for youropponent. Add its SKILLscore. Thistotal is theopponents Attack
Strength.
2. Roll two dice for yourself. Add the number rolled to your current SKILL score. This total is your Attack
Strength.
3. If your Attack Strength is higher than your opponent's is, you have wounded it. Proceed to step
4. If your opponent's Attack Strength is higher than yours is, it has wounded you. Proceed to step 5. If both
Attack Strength totals are the same, you have avoided each other's blows - start the next Attack Round
from steps 1 above.
4. You have wounded your opponent; so subtract 2 points from its STAMINA score. You may use LUCK
here to do additional damage (see below). Proceed to step 6.
5. Your opponent has wounded you; so subtract 2 points from your STAMINA score.
You may use LUCK to reduce the loss of STAMINA (see below). Proceed to step 6.
6. Make the appropriate adjustments to either your opponents or your own STAMINA scores (and your
LUCK score if you used LUCK - see over).
7. Begin the next Attack Round, starting again at step 1 with your current SKILL score. This
sequence continues until the STAMINA score of either you or your opponent reaches zero (death). If your
opponent dies, you are free to continue with your adventure.
If you die, your adventure ends and you must start all over again by creating a new character.

                                                 LUCK

At various times during your adventure, either in battles or when you come across other situations in
which you could either be Lucky or Unlucky (details of these are given in the relevant pages
themselves), you may use LUCK to make the outcome more favourable to you. However, beware! Using
LUCK is a risky business and, if you are unlucky, the results could be disastrous.

The procedure for Testing your luck is as follows: roll two dice. If the number rolled is less than or
equal to your current LUCK score, you have been Lucky and the outcome will be in your favour. If
the number rolled is higher than your current LUCK score, you have been Unlucky and will be
penalised.

Each time you Test your Luck, you must subtract 1 point from your current LUCK score. Thus,
you will soon realise that, the more you rely on your LUCK, the more risky this procedure will
become.



                                                    5


                                     USING LUCK IN BATTLES

In battles, you always have the option of using your LUCK either to score a more serious wound on
an opponent you have just wounded or to minimise the effects of a wound you have just received.

If you have just wounded an opponent: you may Test your Luck as described above. If you are
Lucky, you have inflicted a severe wound; deduct an extra 2 points from your opponent's
STAMINA score. However, if you are Unlucky, however, your blow only scratches your opponent, and
you deduct only 1 point from your opponent's STAMINA (instead of scoring the normal 2 points of
damage, you now only score 1).

If the opponent haswounded you: you may Test your Luck to try to minimise the wound. If you are
Lucky, your opponent's blow only grazes you; deduct only 1 point from your STAMINA. If you are
Unlucky, your wound is a serious one and you must deduct 1 extra STAMINA point (i.e., a total of 3
points from your own STAMINA). Remember: you must subtract 1 point from your LUCK score
each time you Test your Luck.

                                                   Skill

Your SKILL score will not change much during the course of your adventure. Occasionally a
paragraph may give you instructions to increase or decrease your SKILL score, but it may not
exceed its initial value unless you are specifically instructed to the contrary.

At various times during your adventure, you will be told to Test your Skill. The procedure for this is the
same as that for Testing your Luck: roll two dice. If the number rolled is less than or equal to your
current SKILL score, you have succeeded in your test and the result will go in your favour. If the number
rolled is higher than your current SKILL score, you have failed the test and will have to suffer the
consequences. However, unlike Testing your Luck, do not subtract 1 point from your SKILL each time
you Test your Skill. Your SKILL score can never exceed its initial value unless specifically instructed on
a page.

                                                   Luck

Additions to your LUCK score may be awarded in the adventure when you have been particularly lucky
or created your own luck by some other action. Details are given, where appropriate, in the paragraphs
of the book. Remember that, as with SKILL and STAMINA, your LUCK score may never exceed its
initial value unless specifically instructed on a page.

                                             EQUIPMENT

You will start your adventure with no equipment, but you may find items during your travels.
Reduce your initial SKILL by 2 points until you find a weapon.

                                           BACKGROUND

The rain lashes the windscreen like a wild insane animal. Why you have to go out at this time of night,
you don't know? Your boss rang you twenty minutes ago to take some papers to Blackwood Manor for
Mr Smith to sign, so a sale can go through quickly.

You drive through the rusty iron gates and drive up the gravel driveway. A dark foreboding wood closes
in on you from both sides until you arrive at the house.

Blackwood Manor towers over you like a malicious giant creature staring at its prey. You get out of the
car, run through the rain and reach the front door stepping in every puddle all the way.

You knock on the door and wait in the darkness shivering. The door snaps and clicks as locks open to
reveal an ancient face. The old man is withered and cracked from years of experience. He is slightly
stooped forward and leans on a wooden walking stick. He wears a brown dressing gown and blue
slippers. `Can I help you?' he asks.

You tell him who you are and he lets you in. Entering the foyer he leads you to the entrance hall
decorated with a black and white chequered floor, red walls and ominous-looking portraits. You turn
left into the study. All the other doors are closed.

The study is dark and lit only by a few candles and a crackling fire in the fireplace. An ornate clock
echoes its ticks throughout the room and sits atop the mantel. Red drapes cover the windows and an
oriental rug fills most of the floor. An oak desk sits in the far corner and two armchairs face the warmth of
the fire where you both sit down.

You take out the papers from your briefcase and hand them to the old man. He ignores them and
stokes the fire with a nearby poker. `This night reminds of an age past. A time I can never forget.
If I had known what was to befall me that night, then I wouldn't have ventured here.' he says as he stares
distantly into the dancing flames.

`Although the day itself was quite eventful, it started when my car broke down just outside a small
village quite near here.' He stares at you and gives you a sickly grin. As you look into his eyes
you see something familiar about them. Have you already met? No, you would have remembered.

Strangely you start to feel drowsy. As he continues his story you start to visualize his very words, when
suddenly...

...the car swerves as you miss the deer standing in the middle of the road and crash into a nearby tree.
You are unhurt but shaken. You clamber out of the car and turn back to look down the road as the
deer walks off into the nearby trees. A sign ahead reads: BLACKWOOD - 3 MILES. You look at
your watch. It's about midday and the sun beats down upon you like a malevolent drummer. A
three-mile hike is upon you since you forgot to bring your mobile phone with you. You hope they have
a garage.

He leads you into his vestry and you sit opposite each other over a small wooden table.    `What you
fought outside is only a small part of what's going on in this area. It has to do with Blackwood
Manor on the other side of the woods to the north. It's a place of devil worshippers and demonic
atrocities. However, recently the locals have started disappearing and strange things have been
happening in the woods. I believe something big is about to happen on a grander scale of literally
demonic proportions.' explains the priest. `I'm getting too old to go demon hunting. Please help.
Fate has led you to this damnable place and you must find a way to stop whatever they are
planning. Go north into the woods and beware of strange goings on. Eventually you will arrive at
the house. It won't be easy getting in but you must and destroy the evil that resides within.' You sit
silently for a few minutes and your heart tells you that you have to help. You both stand up, shake
hands and leave.

hang around the chamber on the walls. A stone altar stands at the opposite end to where you came
in. About twenty people dressed in black robes are chanting to a man wearing a scarlet robe, and
stands before the altar. He holds aloft a black ebony skull with eyes that glow. A bolt of blue
lightning shoots out of the skull and hits the altar. In a flash of blue light a creature forms in
demonic shape.

The Count is almost ready to bring the demon to earth. You must stop him now. However, one of the cult

be destroyed first before you kill the demon as they are intrinsically linked.' The voice fades and you step
