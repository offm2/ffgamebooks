WEREWOLF PROWESS
As a werewolf, your strengths are different than when you were a human. You will either
be stronger or weaker as a were creature. So, during battles instead of using your SKILL
you will use your Werewolf Prowess status. Sometimes in place of testing your luck you
may be asked to test your Werewolf Prowess, method is the same as testing your luck
except you don't lose any Werewolf Prowess points. Testing your Werewolf Prowess
sees if you are stealthy in most situations, can sniff out hidden mechanisms, or agile
enough in dodging. In certain situations, it is possible to lose Prowess points. When you
are a werewolf don't use your SKILL during battles that is only a human stat.

WEAPONS
Some weapons will give you bonus hit points in a place where stamina is hard to come
by.

   RISE OF THE NIGHT CREATURES
        Little Finny had one eye dangling by a thread, but he was the most beloved
creature to a seven year old boy. The toddler would play with his teddy bear in the
nursery and talk to it and they had some good conversations. This little boy had no


friends, so he spent most of his time indoors. He ran about the manor, played hide, and
seek with his older sisters. One night, he heard his father screaming and went to check on
the commotion. Then he heard it, the distinct sound of father's chainsaw. The boy ran
into the hallway, peered over the balcony that overlooked the indoor pool and watched
his father attack mother. He sawed her in two and he kicked her halves into the pool,
filling it with a scarlet hue. The water engulfed as much of her as it could. Father turned
off the chainsaw and glanced up. He looked surprised at first, but then he lowered his
eyebrows and became stern.

         &quot;Go away, son. I'll be there in a minute to put you to bed.&quot; He ordered in a strict
tone, and then walked away out of sight.

         The little boy couldn't see where he went, but heard the chainsaw start up again
and blood curdling screams worst than that of his mother followed. He could hear his
father laughing manically; he could hear the chainsaw's teeth biting flesh and bone. The
little boy could only guess it was one of his sisters now being attacked. The toddler ran
back to the nursery and slammed the door. In the shadow of a lit candle he hid by the crib
until the noises stopped. Then there were those footsteps, arriving angrily, heavily, and
eagerly. They stopped outside the door. The little boy brought his knees close to his chest
and held dearly onto Finny, who didn't seem worried at all by all of this. The doorknob
jiggled violently then halted. The moment felt like some ghost trying to get in or the ugly
creature that hid in children's closets but only struck after bedtime. Then the door flung
open and his father stepped in, his hair was dishevelled, he was soaked in sweat and
painted in ruby wetness. His chainsaw was red with the family's blood and decorated in
shards of skin.

         &quot;Where are you?&quot; He whispered harshly and noticed his son on the floor. The
tone that came next was almost welcoming. &quot;Ah, there you are. It is time, so put your toy
away and come here.&quot;

         The little boy kissed his teddy, got to his feet so he could place it in the crib, and
the chainsaw started up again...

BACKGROUND
         You recall that night you decided to take a shortcut through the back alley at 3AM
when the street was dead of traffic. You just left your job at Zailee's Bar and you, being
the bartender, finally packed up and started for home. A dark entity slammed into you
and you thought either a mugger wanted your wallet or you were going to be murdered.
Whatever it was it bit deep into your right forearm and drew blood. Your head slammed
into the brick wall and you passed out for a couple of minutes. When you came to your
wallet was still in your back pocket but now there was a nasty bite mark on your arm.
Fearing for the worse you hailed down a cab and went to the nearest hospital. Once in the
ER they stitched you up, asked many questions and even get the police involved. You
couldn't give much detail since it was dark and you couldn't see the face of your
assailant. What damage was done to your arm was indeed like a dog bite and the nurses
were confused as to why you think a mugger would have attacked you.


         You know it was a human, you're not stupid. It was probably some deranged
lunatic. Either way they sent you home and when you finally plopped on your bed, you
woke up two hours later in a sweat and slight fever. There was a rotten odour coming
from your wound and it has bled through the bandages. You took off the dressing to
examine the marks and noticed that it has stopped bleeding and although delicate to the
touch (hurts like hell) it healed rather quickly. You got up, washed your face and noticed
your eyes were severely bloodshot and your fingernails grew some since your nap. That
day you stayed home and vegged out in front of the TV. When it was time to go to work
all that was left to the wound were the bite marks and a bruise around it. That night you
worked, making your famous cocktails and shooters, and when it was time to leave, you
went back down that dark alley hoping to meet your attacker but there was no one. That
night your fever worsened and in your living room, you felt a pain in your gut that didn't
go away. You thought you should call an ambulance but at that second your fingernails
started to grow longer and hair leaked out of your flesh. Hollering in pain and falling to
the floor, a snout burst through your mouth and ripped your face into two parts. Your
blood spilled all over the carpet and flesh exploded against the wall as the wolf inside you
broke free.
         That night, you transformed into a vicious creature of the twilight.
</div><div id="1">

After your transformation, there is a message on your cell from your lover and this person
is wondering about you and wants to see you. There is a gnawing pain in your instincts
and you want to mate. In an hour, your body goes back to human form and you're left
panting and freaked out by your experience. You take a hot shower to relax again and
contemplate returning the phone call but you don't bother. Sitting on the couch observing
the bloody mess on the walls of your room helps you decipher the fact that your back
alley attacker must have been a werewolf or something. The bite marks on your arm have
healed and are now just scars. You feel stronger, your senses are finely tuned, and your
urge to have sex is heightened. You're not sure when your next `turn' will be but it's not
something you cannot avoid now.

You know the local owner of Cauldron, Books &amp; Devils and she brightens your day as
you enter her shop. She knows you by name since you have come here to buy sage sticks
or black candles for your dungeon. You're not Wiccan but you can be spiritual at times
and believe in energies, demons, spirits and dark magick.

&quot;What brings you here so early in the morn?&quot;

You explain what happened to you and show her the scars. Her lips press together and
her eyes show concern. &quot;Have you `turned' yet?&quot;

You nod strictly. She rummages through her shelves and then through a few boxes
holding items which are not for sale. Her shop as you glance around is filled with an old
wizard's eye candy: beeswax candles, incense sticks, quartz clusters, idols, handmade
soaps, pendulums and Ouija boards. She comes back to you empty handed, &quot;I'm afraid


I'm all out of Belladonna but if you go to the Crimson Manor just north and a few miles
out of town the owner may have it.&quot;

&quot;I don't want to bother him.&quot; You say. &quot;I hear he's a little insane.&quot;

&quot;Then I will phone first, hang on...&quot; She rushes to where her cell sits and calls a number.
She says Lycanthropy to whoever is on the other line and listens intently then hangs up.
&quot;He has one sprig left and says it will be not cheap to purchase but he will deliver it to me
tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;I can't wait that long.&quot;

&quot;Then you will have to go up there yourself and get it.&quot;

&quot;Weren't there hideous axe murders there? Isn't that place cursed or something? The
previous owner hacked up his entire family!&quot; You don't care too much for the Crimson
Manor for you've heard rumours that it is filled with evil creatures and other unworldly
things. Visitors are simply not welcome there. Things happen that aren't explained and
even the police avoid that area.

&quot;Yes, but the dead can't harm the living. I do hope you feel better after you eat the herb.
Just go home and sleep it off.&quot;

You fall asleep for only a moment on the couch when you get back home and have
nightmares about the Crimson Manor. Something demonic is calling you there. It had just
sent its succubus to suckle you, to draw you in, to get you started and wanting more.

Later that day, you decide to drive out north to the unspeakable house just as the sun is
setting; you must turn right off the main highway and down a long dirt road cutting
through a forest. There are potholes and bumps, this road is not maintained at all and
soon the vaulted roof comes into view. The old manor is two to three stories high with
one turret, many dusty windows and a worn wooden exterior. All of the plant life is
overgrown weeds and thorny bushes; you pull up to the circular driveway and get out of
your car. Heavy drapes cover the windows on the main floor so you cannot see inside.
The porch looks lopsided like it's ready to collapse come the next heavy hailstorm. It is a
massive home but has been left to rot; it must've been a beautiful sight when it was brand
new: the gardens, the fountains, the driveway, the sparkling glass and grey wood.

The front door opens by itself and you can see the giant foyer beyond. Carefully, you step
up onto the porch and enter. The door swings closed behind you with a big bang.
Strangely, from inside everything looks polished. Nothing has a speck of dust upon it.
The white and beige tiled floor is waxed, the Turkish weave on the peach marble
stairwell is well kept and the colossal brass chandeliers above have lit candles in them.
Nice sight but it's still eerie, even the smirking gargoyles that are perched on their spot at
the base of the stairwell watch your every move.


Will you call out to see if anyone comes (turn to 15) examine the front door (turn to 130)
or search the area quietly perhaps you can find the Belladonna on your own and get out
of there quickly (turn to 35)?

&quot;MURDERER!&quot; She howls. You wonder what she could mean by that as she steps down
the staircase, you can sense her aggression. But there's no point arguing with her.
&quot;Murderer.&quot;

This time this word echoes throughout the room as if she were from some other
dimension. It sounds dreamlike, did you hear that correctly or is your mind playing tricks
on you, you wonder? But that is the least of your concerns right now, for the Gargoyles
hasten in your direction like a pair of guard dogs and surround you, looking for an angle
to bite where you're most vulnerable. You put your car key between your index finger
and middle finger and make a fist, it's not much of a weapon, but it will have to do.

Damn. Damn. Damn it.

Bethel eventually comes to an end. To your immediate left is a sitting area located in a
corridor which stretches west, possibly linking up with Tormentilia. To your right is a
narrow hall, and there are a few doors in that hall. The seating area offers nothing of
value except if you sit there you will only gain some relaxation but no comfort to your
troubled thoughts. Will you go into the narrow hall (turn to 196) head west (turn to 57) or
walk back up Bethel (turn to 158)?
</div><div id="4">

To the right of you are gothic like arches with very long thin drapes hanging down. You
peek through them and spy an indoor pool, the ceiling is a domed window, but you
cannot see the sky for the glass is slightly tinted. It appears arches and curtains surround
the entire pool area. On the second storey is a balcony, which spans the entire
circumference of the pool area, so supposedly at one time when this house was active
guests upstairs could see below. There is also a staircase leading up to the second floor
from here. Where do you wish to explore next? Will you examine the pool (turn to 122)
go up the stairs (turn to 150) ignore this place and keep going up the hall (turn to 72) or
turn around completely and go back to the foyer (turn to 35)?

The gloomy room has a few double loaders and dryers. Dirty clothes are strewn about the
floor and laundry baskets upturned. There is a strong mouldy smell in here; it is so strong
it causes you to choke a little. As you walk in further you see somebody standing in the
far corner wearing only a nightgown. She screams and charges at you, butcher knife in
her bloody claw. You grab her wrist and struggle but she's determined to stab you in the
face. The tip of the blade scratches your cheek and the second time it punctures you
beneath your eye. In anger, your grip intensifies and not caring if you break her wrist you
resist her as much as possible. Then she goes limp, her eyes roll back into her head and
she falls down, dropping her weapon. You kick it away, kneel down you her, and try to
revive her. Her eyes open, and she is in tears. &quot;Why didn't you rescue us?&quot; She says
dryly.

&quot;What happened to you?&quot; You ask, taking her by the hand.

&quot;This place...this house... my father...and why are you here?&quot; She can barely utter these
words. Then you notice the blood staining her gown by her abdomen.

&quot;What have you done to yourself?&quot;

&quot;I did it; I can't stay here any longer. I have to go to Heaven...stabbed myself, tried to
gut myself. But here you are.&quot; She gulps and smiles gently. &quot;You must leave this house,
if my father finds you...he will...he will...&quot;

&quot;What.&quot;

&quot;Why are you here?&quot;

&quot;Belladonna. Where does your father keep the Belladonna?&quot; You feel stupid asking this,
but you're desperate. And yes, you will take her out of here and get her to a hospital. She
points weakly to the ceiling, her hands are drenched in blood. &quot;In his study, there...
is...there...is...&quot;

&quot;Tell me.&quot;

She closes her eyes, she can hardly talk now. &quot;My father is dead but he lives on in this
house. You mustn't stay here. Killed the family. My sisters, my mother... can't find my
little brother... chainsaw...&quot;

&quot;What's in the study?&quot;

&quot;You need...strange keys to...to open it...herbs...poison...Belladonna.&quot;

&quot;Keys? Where are they?&quot;


&quot;Everywhere... secret keys they are. All numbered. I tried to find them but he-&quot;

You lift her up to take her out of this room but she passes out and chokes on her last
dying breath. So, now you're panicking and when you place her head slowly on the
ground you cover her body with a large towel. Strange keys? Did you find keys while on
your excursion in this place? Are these the keys she's talking about? You sit there for a
moment and try to figure out what is going on here. You were positive there were no
living members of the axe murder family still alive. Then, if her father is dead yet still
alive, who did your friend at the metaphysical shop speak to? So far, you haven't
encountered him. Something is not right here, and now your fear is growing, it is indeed
time to get out of this house before something else happens. You leave the basement and
go upstairs to the main floor.

Turn to 116.

The room beyond is murky, shielded from the outside light by heavy black velvet drapes.
There is a mini flashlight on your keychain which you realise can be put to good use.
This must be the front parlour, for there is a gargantuan brick fireplace, and in the
darkness is looks like a yawning mouth. Nineteenth century furniture is situated about,
sofas, lounges, chairs and fancy old tables. You nearly trip over a rug coming in; the door
gently closes behind you, engulfing the room in shadows. You search the tables, anything
that has drawers but find only tarots cards, dried flower assortments, and candles. Soot
falls down in the fireplace sending a phantom of dust into the air. Something moves
beneath the large carpet in your direction, you keep a steady hand of your only available
light upon it hoping it to be a rat or your eyes playing tricks on you, but nothing comes
out from underneath the rug. You scan the room with your flashlight and spy a pair of
French doors on the opposite end of the room, a sinister shadow moves across the glass to
the other side, or was it your flashlight being weird? Frozen in place, you stand there and
then your light source starts to fade out then comes back on. If it goes out you'll be in
pitch blackness, but you haven't gone too far, you still know how to get out if your
device quits on you. Creepy, and the battery is fresh, you just bought it. Will you
investigate what that shadow was at the French doors (turn to 172) stay where you are for
a few seconds longer (turn to 79) or leave this room and return to the foyer (turn to 35)?

There are two doors opposite each other in Malkuth, one is aptly called the Voodoo
Room while the other is simply a clean bed chamber. Do you wish to enter the Voodoo
Room? If you're brave enough and not afraid of a little magick, then do so by turning to
182. Perhaps there's something within the bedroom? You could go in there by turning to
64. If you wish to return to the foyer stair landing, turn to 25.

The piano is out of tune, in fact is sounds so horrible you stop playing the wretched thing
but find to your amazement that it continues on playing as if it has a mind of its own. You
try everything to turn it off but it just won't shut up. You give up and decide what to do
next. Will you go through the closed double doors (turn to 36) walk up the corridor you
came from and return to the pool's lounging area (turn to 11) go down the hallway which
leads back into the big main foyer, return to 35.

You puke in your mouth a little, your tongue feels so weird, and you can barely swallow
now. Quickly, you rush back into the room and examine the caviar. It's not caviar,
they're Cane Toad eggs. Son of a bitch! And you ate a lot of them. You call the
emergency line and discover your cell phone is out of service and then you receive a text
message.

                                     Thought you might
                                     enjoy the meal. 
                                     You're fucked.
                                             - Anon

Your innards are on fire now. To dilute the poison you drink an entire bottle of wine and
a jug of water. It's too late. You run out into the foyer, open the front door, and are
blasted off your feet by a mighty explosion! Grasping your throat, a creature from Hell
emerges from the floor. It has the wingspan of a great demon and a flaming aura of
indigo. Then it vanishes into thin air as if ascending into Heaven. You crawl desperately
for the front exit as weakness takes over. You can see your car, you can almost feel it, but
you will not get out of this house alive. The front door slowly closes. There's nothing left
to do but die on that cold floor. Be careful of what you eat in your next life when you're
reincarnated.
</div><div id="10">

This just won't do, the mixture is still highly noxious and you continue to transform.
There must be something you've missed, some vital information? You get to experience a
most dreadful turn, one you never thought you could handle, and on top of that you are
dying from the collective poison you just took. It's a terrible combination, which tears
your soul apart. Your adventure is over.
</div><div id="11">

There is nothing special about the pool's seating quarters. To your left is a hidden
ascending stairwell, the steps are covered in a showy red carpet. Also to your left are the
rear doors of the manor, and you can see a vast garden beyond. Further down the corridor
past the pool are more rising stairs with blue carpeting on them, and yet another lounge
area. These stairs could possibly be for the servants who would come out of the kitchen
in the morning to bring the master his breakfast. There is a hallway on the right, which


leads back to the main foyer. You wonder where to investigate next, so far you haven't
met anyone who lives here, and it's rather strange to be wandering around in somebody
else's home like this. But strange things have happened haven't they?

These are your choices:
Walk over to the next lounge area, turn to 162.
Go up the stairs with the blue carpet, turn to 179.
Go up the stairs with the red carpet, turn to 154.
Look out the back door, turn to 149.
Go to where the pool is, turn to 4.
Walk back up to the other corridor on the other side of the pool's seating area, return to
72.
Go all the way back down the hall that leads into the foyer, return to 35.

With much effort you manage to get the door open wider and squeeze in, the room is dark
but with your trusty flashlight you make out some sort of salon or sitting room. You look
behind the door to see what the hell was against it and find a naked body bloated beyond
relief and purging all over the carpet. Every time it moves gases escape from it. You
cover your mouth with your arm and quickly dart around the room. The whole area is
infested with a stench. You have entered the Black Plague room, a very entertaining but
notorious chamber, and because you were so desperate to get in here you will lose 2
STAMINA points every second you stay in here. So, since you've walked in, you must
subtract 2 STAMINA points. The disease doesn't care if you're a werewolf or not. Old
clothes lay strewn about on the torn furniture, there is even a clawed tub in here set next
to a fireplace. You find a monkey head, already a study of some taxidermist, and examine
it, and as you're staring at it it bites you on the hand. You let go of the head and drop
your flashlight in the process. There are desks in here but now you have a festering bite
wound and the pong in here is overwhelming. You're not sure how much longer you wish
to stay in this place. Do you want to search the desks? If so, turn to 165.

To leave before you lose more stamina, will you go back out and open Sardonyx (turn to
32) keep going up Bethel, but with caution (turn to 3) or leave Bethel altogether without
exploring and return to the upper landing of the main staircase (turn to 25)?

When you lift the receiver to your ear you say nothing, only listen.

&quot;Who's there?&quot; says a man's rough voice.

You still remain silent.

&quot;I know you're in my house, going through my stuff like the little thief that you are. Do
you think I'll let you out of here alive with that Belladonna?&quot;


The line goes dead.

Just as you're about to leave, metal shutters come down over the windows and slam shut
on the floor with a deafening bang. Even the doors out of this room close and lock. There
is a loud hiss and you know it is some sort of gas escaping into the room. The longer you
stay in here and expose yourself to the odourless, colourless fumes you will lose 8
STAMINA points. Frantically, you scan the dark room with your flashlight and put your
face in the nook of your arm hoping it will buy you time.

Test your luck. If successful, turn to 145. Every time you fail, you will lose 8 STAMINA
points. This gas is highly toxic and now you're starting to feel light-headed.

You open the file and a flickering skull and crossbones appears on the screen, then a box
comes up like some unwanted pop up ad:

                           Vang Vang claw

The computer short circuits and smokes violently. Lose 1 LUCK point. You have been
cursed! And by a computer's naughty program. So, it appears you will age forty years by
tomorrow unless you can find some lotus flowers and a specific claw. It seems like a
blessed release from your lycanthropy affliction, but you don't want to die, you will fight
back. You push the computer off the desk in a temper and stomp out of the room.

What next?

Your voice echoes off every surface and comes back at you; it sends a shiver up your
spine to be this alone in such a strange place. And no one comes. The candles flicker,
almost going out sending a shadow over the entire room. How disturbing it would be if
they did go out, but thankfully they don't. You can hear someone crying upstairs and then
it fades. Now you are determined someone is here, you're not alone after all. You call out
again, this time cupping your hands over your mouth. An orb of light is seen coming
down the stairs and dissolves into the floor at the base of the stairwell. The candles in the
chandeliers sputter and burn out sending the entire foyer into complete blackness. You
swear you can see a tall figure standing on the staircase in the darkness. You have a mini
flashlight attached to your key chain; will you light it and aim it at what you think you are
seeing (turn to 189) or will you spin on your heel and get the hell out of there (turn to
130)?

Insane times calls for desperate measures and you bull through oncoming attackers
knocking them over on their back. Bullets fly through the air in all directions, hitting the
light fixtures, walls and ceiling. Everyone is desperate to get a piece of you. The front
door is right there, and the foyer is so much wider then when you first entered, it seems
like it might take you an eternity to bound across it. You widen your leaps and in the
second you're charging, a creature much larger than you comes out of the floor and
blocks you from the door. Its wingspan is enormous; there is an azure glow about its
body. It is in fact a king demon and it blows a harsh gale of freezing air at you forcing
you away. The fur on your face is slightly scorched. The militants aren't bothered by this
being from hell because they are advocates of its forces, they serve this monster, for it is
their master. It stomps its clawed foot on the floor and growls loudly and the chandelier
comes crashing down. Test your WEREWOLF PROWESS. Are you quick enough to get
out of the way before the colossal chandelier falls on top of you? If you are unsuccessful
at the test, the fixture will kill you instantly.

&quot;This one is mine,&quot; the creature warns the men in a baleful cold-blooded tone. It sends
shivers down your spine.

Will you fight this thing and win your freedom out of the Crimson Manor? A shit hole of
all places and the gateway to hell. The men who were once hunting you now gather
around to watch this thing destroy and devour you. A werewolf versus a demon? How
quaint. But you can still run away and find another exit from this place. What is your

Due to the carnage, one bites you on the calf, lose 2 STAMINA points, but you manage to
scamper up the stairs and get in the door. You struggle to slam it shut not caring if a snout


gets caught. The dogs jump at the door and scratch at it, barking, growling and snarling.
But you're safe now. You take a breather and head back into the crescent corridor. Return

You peak around the corner of Tormentilia; he is looking the other way. Good. You creep
up on him and jump on him before he has a chance to react. Without hesitation you bite
deep into his throat and rip it clean from his body. Blood splatters across your snout. The
salty taste of his blood excites you, you want more. He never knew what hit him because
it happened so fast. There are additional footsteps coming from down the hall, so you
hide around the corner. Two men come up Bethel from what you can see by peaking over
the balcony.

&quot;He's up here,&quot; one says. &quot;I can smell him.&quot;

Will you make a sudden ambush on them (turn to 77) wait for them to reach you and then
attack (turn to 174) or run back down the Tormentilia and all the way around to sneak up

It stinks in here, the corpse is no exception. The kitchen is a big mess of cutlery,
dinnerware and copper pots. The ghouls really made themselves at home in here. On the
counter is a bottle filled with red liquid, it seems to fizz up when you shake it. You also
find a silver dog tag with the number #1 on it. It looks important, so you put it in your
pocket. You want to arm yourself with a weapon but cannot find any knives or anything
sharp enough to use. Could you fight more ghouls by knocking them over the head with
one of these pots? Or maybe you could stab it with a fork? Nah, you'll have to keep
searching, hopefully you won't need a weapon though. Your plan is to get out of this
house as quickly as possible as soon as you have found your cure herb. Will you
rummage around the cupboards and pantry (turn to 119) check the fridge (turn to 55) or
drink the red liquid in the bottle (turn to 167)?

The lights are coming on and then going out. During your exploit of the house most of
the lights never worked, but here they are annoying you to the bone. You can hear your
hunters' tip-toeing about, but you can't see them. You try not to peak over the railing
overlooking the pool too much for fear of being seen.

Will you look over the railing anyway to see if you can see anyone (turn to 88) or keep
low and go to the top landing of the staircase in the foyer (turn to 34)?

&quot;SHIT!&quot; He yells as you knock his weapon out of his grasp. Swiftly you bite off his face
and fling him across the room. He is still alive though and tries to stand up. You give him
hardly any time to recuperate and pounce on him, you can smell the fear on the man and
without thinking you execute him by slashing his throat with your claw. No one comes to
his rescue and quietly you let yourself out into the corridor. Turn to 155.

There are crude marks upon the door; it looks as though some crazed maniac attacked it
with a chainsaw. Trying not to make a sound, you enter the room and look around. Once
again the light switch doesn't work so you have to use your flashlight. The room is fairly
large and it is jointed. The first room has a bed for a toddler and a crib, the room farthest
looks like a play area disorganized with all kinds of toys. Stepping in, you carefully
analyze your surroundings and when you're in the middle of the room this sweetest,
innocent little voice speaks from within the shadows. &quot;Mommy?&quot;

You spin around and scan the room but can't find where the voice came from. &quot;Who's
there?&quot;

A giggle from behind you is nerve wracking and startling because you can't find where
this is coming from. Soot from the fireplace spills out and smothers the floor sending up a
big ominous cloud; it looks like some phantom rising out of the ground. Then you see an
image in it, a small person emerges from the blur of soot. Squinting your eyes to get a
closer look you realise it is a boy of about the age of six or seven, you're not quite sure.
He is carrying a teddy bear under his arm, but his sudden appearance is not what alarms
you it's the gash across his belly and his intestines leaking out and dragging across the
floor. In his other hand, he holds a butcher knife. Stumbling over your words all you can
utter is &quot;What the-&quot;

He lifts the knife and growls. Then the door slams shut and locks. In the darkness, he
charges and sticks the knife deep into your thigh. While you're yanking it back out the
whole room fills with the soot from the fireplace, and it comes at you more wrathfully
than the boy did. It wraps around your ankles and yanks you off your feet. You land hard
on your back and can feel the ashes trying to get into your mouth; it is trying to smother
you. As you struggle, you see the boy standing over you, staring at you as if you were the
one who caused him grief.

&quot;You will die, and then we can play.&quot; He says and runs away into the obscurity.
Meanwhile this cloud is choking you; it feels solid enough that you can actually grab
hold of it. Then the boy comes back dragging an axe. &quot;All I want is your head.&quot; He says
so harmoniously and he even gives you a silly laugh.

During the battle, if your STAMINA falls to 2, turn to 127.

There is nowhere to run, you're not a coward, your life is too important. On either side of

Your attempt to destroy these guys is noble and brave, but they have guns, you do not.
Good thing there are no silver bullets or you'd really be in the shit.

The staircase to the foyer is wide and there are double doors at the top landing. There are
corridors leading off toward the west wing and east wing then those that veer north
further back into the manor. The halls are all named too so navigating isn't difficult. You
stand on the top of the stairs wondering in which direction to explore. To your left is a
short corridor called Chokmah and to your right is a short corridor named Malkuth. There
are two very long dark halls going deeper into the house. The one on the left off of
Chokma is called Tormentilia and the one on the right just off of Malkuth is named
Bethel.

You arrive at a clearing where dark coloured peacocks are sifting through the
wildflowers. If you eat one of these birds you will be granted 4 STAMINA points. You
can only hunt them once, for they will take flight if you come back for more. You come
to a four-way junction and if you head south, you'll be going back toward the entrance of
the maze and that's not the way you want to go. You are standing in the eastern section,
obviously having come from that way. There are two options then, you can head west,
unless you've been this way prior (turn to 169) or go north (turn to 118).

The room beyond is pitch black as black as Edgar Allen Poe's mind. You step in and
notice it must be some sort of den, for there are flat screen TVs on the wall, a mini bar
and a large elliptical shaped couch set in the floor. There is an assortment of strange
mirrors in here and a disco ball. You decide to check for anything useful when the door
slams and the silence becomes nerve wracking. A woman sighs and you're sure it came
from where there is another room. Quietly, you step in this direction and ready any
weapon you have, even if it be just a key held tightly between your fingers, ready to stab
anything in the neck should it come close. You arrive in a room where there's an emperor
sized bed, must be one of the guest bed chambers. Then you hear the sound of naked feet
pattering on the floor, the jangle of ankle bracelets. Arms wrap around your waist and
chest, startled you try to run but are abruptly halted by someone standing in the door. You
flash the light on whoever it is and see it is a young woman, naked, and the one who is
behind you is also naked. The one in the door smiles and her teeth are jagged and pointy,
there aren't any gums in her mouth, for they have rotted away. Something whispers in
your ear, a lustful whim, and arms coil around your body again. The one at the door, the
husky brown-haired woman with large tits and cold nipples comes forward. You notice
that her skin starts to disintegrate until a portion of her ribcage is showing. She kisses you
on the lips and for a moment you feel submissive, even though her eyes are lifeless, even
though she smells of the grave, and even though you are in danger. It doesn't matter. You
let these girls fondle and caress you all over. You love it most when they loosen your
pants and their hands find your groin. To your right another person arrives, but you know
not from where he actually came from. He is a young man like those Roman slaves,
beautiful and above suspicion. He carries a red candle dressed in herbs and you can smell
the lemon peel and rose musk. The flame is very enticing so much so that now you can't
stop staring at it, you have become mesmerized.

&quot;Give me your arm.&quot; He says rather softly and courteously and he holds out his hand as
an invitation. You oblige, and give him your right hand and he clasps it tightly. He opens
his mouth and brings your arm to his lips and without any hesitation bites deep into your
forearm. Blood spills out from the wound, but you feel no pain as he chews happily on
your flesh. Then you feel more biting, the girls have lifted your shirt and started gnawing
on your torso.


Roll two dice. Will you get your sanity back and escape? Or will you be eaten alive by
these ghouls? Keep track of what was rolled first then roll again and compare. If the
second amount was higher, turn to 49. If it was equal to or lower, you don't get your
mind back. You watch them taking bites of you. Then in a desperate passion, they bring
you to the floor violently, take away your flashlight and start assaulting you with their
teeth. Eventually you will pass out because of severe blood loss.

You hear the distinct sounds of someone running up on you and as you spin around there
is no time to defend yourself, a tall man wielding an axe swings it and embeds it deep
into your cranium. The sudden crunch of your skull sends a shockwave of pain through
the course of your body. All you recall before passing out are his angry red eyes, smoke
squeezing out of the sockets. Blood fills your mouth and your legs turn to jelly, the
flashlight sputters out sending you into a world of eternal darkness.

The portcullis painfully lifts on its rusty gears and goes back down once you're through,
now you find yourself in the basement of the house. After your experience, you really
want out of this house and the light switch doesn't work down here so you rely on your
mini flashlight. You flick the beam of light outward and spy what looks like a winery.
There must be over two hundred bottles stuffed in its own alcove. There is also a table
with six chairs around it, probably for the specific wine drinkers to have a place to sit and
chat. There are three doors down here. One is marked boiler room, laundry, and the other
has no title. You also notice a plaque on the wall with many hooks and dangling off these
hooks are keys. They all look like identical brass keys except for one which looks like
polished steel. You take it, but you're unsure of what it opens. Anyways, add STEEL
KEY to your possessions if you haven't already.

You realise you are exposing yourself by being up here but you can't keep being a mouse
in a maze, you have to get out of here. A sniper starts firing at you from the house but
lucky for you misses with every shot. Quickly you slip back into the shadows having
jumped over a few passages below. You leap back into the maze and hurry for an exit.
Just as you're searching a man steps out and bars your way. He is dressed in a dark three-
piece suit and a Dirby. He looks like he's not of the modern era. There is a smirk on his
ugly round face that sets the hairs on your back to stand. The two of you circle each other
as if sizing one another up for some sort of battle. He looks very familiar, so familiar in
fact, you recognise him finally as the man in the dark alley. Will you attack (turn to 123)
or continue to threaten him but do nothing (turn to 163)?

The second you enter this dark chamber something wet plops on top of your head and
sticks to your scalp. In alarm you claw at it to get it off and find to your horror the more
you struggle with it the more there is a sudden piercing pain throughout your skull.
Whatever this thing is it's burrowing into through your flesh and bone. You run around
the room and fall on the floor. Some creature rolls out from beneath the bed in your
direction. In your flashlight's flare, you can see that it is a black vein-pumped blob and it
moves fast, it leaves a thick slimy film behind it. If you have a +2 weapon, you must kill
this living glob immediately before it pounces on you then you will worry about the one
that's still on your head. If you do not have this level of weaponry then you will become
easily overwhelmed and will die a slow death only fit for the worst of criminals, but
you're no criminal, it's just the severe fatality you must suffer as if you were one. Should
you destroy the second monster then the only thing to do is pull off the other one. Will
you be successful or will you take off the skin on your scalp with it? Test your skill. If
you pass this test, turn to 143.

It is indeed a gallery, but nothing special about it. Does art interest you? There are many
murals and paintings in here. One captures your attention; it is a Japanese inspired oil
painting, much taller than you are. A warrior is lying on the ground amidst a forest of
bamboo, but one thing strikes you as odd, there is a bamboo shoot sticking out of his
abdomen but there is no blood on his robes. Such a queer piece of fine workmanship, but
what does it mean? Then his eyes flick open and he stares at you, gawking into your soul
like some Praying Mantis. He grins shrewdly. There is a sense of great evil and a feeling
of alarm now, but you find that your feet are glued to the floor and your limbs are stiff as
a board and worse yet, your eyes won't leave his glare. Are you wearing a talisman


around your neck? If you are wearing this, turn to 87. If not (or it's in your pocket

The front door is on your mind, with your supernatural powers, you will smash through
that door. Nothing will stop you this time. When you reach the main stairwell of the foyer
you are impeded in your very tracks for the foyer is swarming with these armed men and
when they see you, they open fire on you. Lose 2 STAMINA points.

&quot;There he is! Get him!&quot; Says one with barking orders, as you turn tail, and go back up the
stairs they chase after you.

Their boot steps are thunderous. Quickly, you race to the very end of the manor and into
the narrow corridor just beyond Bethel Hall. How will you outsmart them? Run down

There are many doors connecting to the grand foyer, above each doorway on the wall
there is an unusual arch vaulted like what one might see in a 1001 Arabian night's palace.
Each door is closed so there is no deciphering what is exactly behind them but they are
colour coded however. Just as you're pondering which one to investigate the chandelier
above starts to rotate slowly as if some breeze is coming in from somewhere, is it a gentle
wind or is it something else moving it? Is your presence sensed and being toyed with?
There is an unnerving feeling about this place and you wonder if the Belladonna is really
that important, but do you really want to live your life as a werewolf? Quietly you step
into the center of the room and speculate where you're going to search first. Behind you
lies the gate to freedom, the front door is at your beckon call. To your left are double red
doors and further down are green ones with metal studs on them as if they belong in some
dungeon somewhere. To your right are black glossy doors with an emblem of a sinister
red dragon on them, dressed up in a mural ready to swallow its next victim and further
down are burgundy doors pointed on top like some vampire fang.

Most libraries in big old houses have some sort of hidden room behind its bookshelves,
and you try to search for the secreted mechanism that will trigger a doorway. The hissing
gas sounds monstrous now. Your flesh feels like it's burning as if acid were poured on it.
Your lungs collapse, you puke up blood, your tongue falls off onto the floor sizzling as if
on fire. You will not live long enough to find this mythical switch; you have wasted too
much precious time. In seconds, you're on the floor writhing in agony as you're your
organs and skin liquefies.

Something is playing tricks on you and you're not in the mood for jokes. Then you're
pushed into the hedge wall with a great force. Black shadow-like creatures emerge from
the fog; their eyes violently blazing opaque white. You spy a STAMINA potion on the
ground where they're standing but you can't get to it. Every time you come closer they
try to scratch you with their massive grisly claws.

&quot;There's the fucker!&quot; and the bullets take to the air in your direction. They have finally

In a heated rage you start swinging blindly as they advance, just as you're about to hit the
nearest one you slip on a blood smear on the floor and fall hard on your back. You bang
the back of your head and black out and when you wake you find yourself already the
course meal of these demonic creatures. They have wasted no time tearing at your
exposed flesh with their canines and shredding your clothes with their claws. You nearly
faint from the pain but can only watch as your blood escapes from your body and seeps
across the floor. It is not even good enough for finger paint, for these savages want more
from you than the thin liquid that once coloured your complexion. The sound of your
own skin ripping apart with great ease, your steaming organs being pulled out of you as if
they were trinkets of treasure, and your bowels being chewed upon within the oral cavity
of your enemy sends you to a world of insane hilarity.

You find a box full of dog tags at the very back nearly hidden out of sight, some

The room is in fact a dining hall but a very unique one. It has medieval studded chairs
and a large heavy oak table. The food is still good; it reminds you of a type of Game of
Thrones feast. The baby pig with an apple in its yap reminds you of the delicacy only a
king would devour. There is duck, lemon dill herring and all kinds of platters piled high
with baklava and fruit. Who was supposed to eat here tonight, you wonder? Set in the
wall on the right is a massive aquarium where all kinds of tropical fish are schooling. It is
the only thing giving the dark room some light. You notice a key on the gravel and
wonder what it is for? If you have a pickaxe you could break the aquarium and retrieve

off. What comes off is your skin. Before you go completely blind you see the blob reach
out and grab hold of your ankle, it yanks on you and pulls you across the floor. You can
hardly fight back, you grab onto anything nearby but the creature is just too strong, and
your sweaty fingers slip. Helpless and in terror, it hauls you into the fridge and engulfs
you. You're folded up like a little infant within its orifice and there you will remain until
you're digested.

The path comes to a dead end but there is a tall statue at the end of it. It is of a cloaked
woman holding onto a crescent moon. She looks up at you and smiles a stone smile. You
feel like you might be in for some trickery but she only acts pleasantly, &quot;If you are in
danger, I will help you only once, but only in a specific situation that I will not reveal to
you. I sense that you don't belong in this evil place. Do take care to get out of this
labyrinth by heading further north.&quot;

Make a note that you have met the GARDEN GUARDIAN.

Instead of investigate further in the maze, you head north. Soon, you come into a massive
clearing and can smell death in the air. It starts to rain as you explore the surrounding
area for an escape route. The rain stings your eyes and it tastes slightly salty, you look up
into the cloudy sky and see little red drops falling down all around you. Licking your
snout, you recognise the flavour of the rain and grasp the concept that the nightly shower
is pure blood. You're not sure what is more paranormal, this blood rain, the silence


capturing the region, or the fog. Then you hear something, but not from the south where
you came from but the path off to the north. It sounds like someone is not in any
particular hurry and is dragging his feet. You wait, frozen, wondering what it is; the scent
in the atmosphere is morbid. Then she emerges finally and it is a naked woman with torn
flesh, her large tits are dangling by threads of skin, thick yellow pus oozes from her
orifices and down her legs. Her stare is vacant and the place where her lips used to be is
chewed away. You back up a bit and something grabs your hind leg, an arm has come out
of the wet soil and has you in a vice grip. You watch as all around you zombies pull
themselves free from the blood soaked mud, no doubt the victims of the axe murderer.
Some are so decayed that their skin is black and ripping off them as they rise out of their
graves. The one who came out of the northern passage attacks you first and with one
backhand of your mighty claw you knock her head clean from her shoulders but that
doesn't stop the rest of her body from crawling in your direction. First, you bite the hand
that has you, separating it from its wrist. The zombie's blood has a gross tang, even as a
werewolf this is nasty. You're soon surrounded by the undead and must fight your way
out.

There is a hunch that maybe this is the mother of the manor, you're not quite sure but as
you're struggling the doll falls out of your clutches and she grabs hold of it. There is a

entity vanishes. You take the pickaxe to the surface and crawl out of the pool. You're not
sure what just happened but whatever was down there just tried to kill you. No worries,

You come to a square shaped clearing, but it appears to be a dead end. You're standing in
a big patch of long grass and weird tulip like flowers are growing wildly throughout. Just
as you're about to turn and leave the grass grabs hold of your limbs and holds you tight,
struggling only makes it worse, for they get tighter and it feels like you're being held by
unforgiving wires. The pain starts to ensue as they rip through your flesh. You're in the
midst of some sort of Crab Grass that feeds on living tissue of animals. There's nothing
you can do to escape, you've been captured, and now you regret ever coming this way.
Soon, if nothing else is done, the grass will poke through your abdomen. It starts to
encircle you around the neck pulling you to the ground. Have you met the GARDEN

arm, all the body parts that once belonged to a woman. You're starting to feel a little
dizzy, and then you hear the reckless noise of a chainsaw. Quickly you grab the BRASS
KEY and put it in your pocket. You open the door to the room you're currently in and
warily peek out, but the sound has stopped. You swear it came from upstairs. Wondering

Someone, a maid perhaps, has done a fine job at polishing the tables and dressing tables.
There's not a speck of dust and the bed sheets are crisp and clean. You rummage through
all the drawers and wardrobe but find no Belladonna. Someone left a Rolex watch in one
of the nightstands. You can take this if you like, but the hands have stopped moving,
battery is dead. There is an uneasy feeling about this room, you feel that you're being
watched, yet no one is present. You watch enough of those ghost-hunting shows to
understand that there might be a spirit in the room with you and your hunches are correct.
A figure in a nightgown steps out of the dressing table mirror, the mirror in some beliefs,
happens to be a gateway between the living and dead. It is a vortex where the dead can
leave their dimension and enter yours. Her hair is all the way down to her ankles, her
hands and feet are black from post mortem stains, and her eyes are as black as shark
when it's ready to attack. In old photographs, just looking at the people's eyes creep you
out, it's as though they can see you through the picture, they're long dead, but still alive,
not rested. She is from one of those turn-of-the-century images... No... you blink, but she
is still there, crouched on the dresser. Just as you're about to say something she parts her
lips and an eel slithers out of her throat, it is too big for her mouth and it rips her lips
apart at the corners. Purple veins pulsate across her face as she experiences this
excruciating act. The eel stretches toward you; its menacing teeth are ready to suckle
your neck.

For some reason as you peer into the pool there doesn't seem to be a bottom. Then the

Water drips off the creature as it is born and you step back but not fast enough, for it

black hair, and a festering hump on its back.

In minutes, you are alone again and thankfully, he doesn't come after you. For some time
you trudge on through the bush, thinking maybe it's time to find the old dirt road you
crossed over in the night. Just as you're checking the contents in your backpack you hear
the distinct crude noise of a chainsaw behind you, glancing over your shoulder, your
heart takes a leap. It is the crazed spirit from Crimson Manor, and he has found you. He
still looks like a ghostly spectre even in the morning hours and wastes no time in chasing
you through the trees. You trip over a root and fall hard on the ground. He stands over
you like some crazy-haired Leatherfaced serial killer and raises his screaming chainsaw
over his head. You can't believe this is real, you can't fathom the idea this is actually
occurring to you, but you will be meeting your end at what appears to be a character out
of a horror movie. He may not look real enough, for you can see right through him and
his weapon of destruction, but as he brings the spinning blades down upon your head,
you feel its effect. You cry out in terror as the chainsaw shreds your cranium to bits and
then there is nothing seconds later. You are dead.

you can't find bullets anywhere. There is a selection of swords from all around the world
but when you go to remove one you find it has been glued to its stand. There are racks
full of staves, spears and scythes and they too cannot budge from their spot. This is a
museum, not a weapons room, you can't use anything! Behind a pane of glass are flimsy
imitation daggers and delicate crystal Athames of all kinds. One interests you, it is made
of silver, and so you break the glass by kicking at it and remove the dagger. It looks like
it might break if you use it in battle so it has no value to up your fighting score. You
suppose it's only for show. If you take it add a +1 SILVER DAGGER to your possessions,
but if you do use it in combat it will only last one round before it shatters and during that
one hit you get in successfully deduct an extra hit point. Perhaps it's meant to be used for
something else other than war? Surely not just in voodoo rituals or whatever? There is
nothing else in here but useless bows bolted to the wall and their arrows glued crudely
with them.

The haze seems to only cover the maze, but you stand tall on top of the hedge wall, you
can see the house from here and even the rain is letting up. You realise you're almost out
of the labyrinth and into another section of the backyard.

Freedom. So close yet so far!

Then there's a BANG from one of the windows upstairs and a silver bullet sinks between
your eye sockets. You have been gunned down by a cunning sniper.

Your lungs are ready to burst, but you swim down and clutch the handle of the axe. Then
the ghostly woman grabs you by your ankles, quickly without hesitating or putting up a

the surface, she heaves you back in the water. You're going to drown. Lose 4 STAMINA

the free air, coughing out your lungs, and stare at the pool in disbelief. The water is clear
as if there was nothing there to begin with, no blood, no body, and no apparition. But for
now, the pickaxe will have to remain on the bottom.

Such a perfect thing when the key fits the lock. You step outside onto a landing and walk
down the staircase. A shiver is sent throughout your bones as the sun sinks beyond the
horizon and vanishes. There is a huge fountain nearby with water still running rampant in
it. A statuette of a goddess holding a cauldron looks to the sky, water overflowing her
pot. On the ledge you find a dog tag with the number #4 on it and slip it into your pocket.
There is a howl in the distance, then many howls. Walking a bit in the backyard, you find
a massive vegetable and herb garden. Someone is growing pumpkins, squash, carrots and
potatoes. In the herb garden there is catnip, mint and.... Belladonna. You blink and look
again making sure you read that right. Yes, Belladonna. Smiling you kneel down and sift
through the leaves until you get to the herb and pull a sprig free. You're not sure what to
do here. Eat it raw? Mix it with something to dilute it? Meditate over it? What?

You pull on a string, which lights up the bulb hanging loosely from the ceiling. There are

canned goods are nearly expired. There is a big bag of marijuana in here, including
wormwood. Hmmm, which one is right for you? You can't be a high werewolf, but it

The forest is endless all around and daylight is exposing you. You hope and pray the
gunmen who hunted you like a dog are not hot on your trail. There is not one path out
here so you find yourself stumbling over branches, rocks and roots. In your desperation
you stagger a few times, causing minor scrapes to your legs and knees. You feel
completely drained, for all you want to do is go home and sleep. The fresh sour odour of
smoke comes to your nostrils and soon enough you find out where it is coming from.
There is an old hut here in the middle of nowhere and it looks like it belongs to a logger
or hillbilly. There are all kinds of skinning apparatuses by his (her?) home and a big pile
of cut firewood. There are lights coming from the windows but obviously not electrical.
Thinking this is your chance to get help a man comes out of the front door and steps out
onto his miniature porch. He is holding a shotgun and aims it in your direction. Without
any warning he simply fires it and the bullets explode into a tree inches from your head.
You hold up your arms to show him you are unarmed but he reloads.

&quot;You better get off my property!&quot; he warns in a loud course voice.

It's best not to take any chances; he is ready to shoot you dead as he takes aim again. As
you turn on your heel, you spy an axe sticking out of a block of wood. He fires at you and
slightly misses, all you can hear is the bang behind you as tree trunks shatter. Those are
bullets with your name on them. Will you stop and risk taking his axe? If you do, turn to

You look around as your body goes back to human form, you know full well this is not
permanent, but it has protected you this one time. Strangely, you do not suffer the loss of
limbs and heal quickly from wounds. Usually. You tear off the mask of your assailant
and find to your disbelief that he has completely evaporated! His clothes begin to deflate
and flatten. What the hell is going on?

You go into the room the man (whatever the heck he was) came out of and find yourself
in some sort of home-made torture chamber. There are dead bodies strung up by their
necks, hooks dug deep into their throat, blood flowing freely down their chests. All kinds
of bloodied meat cleavers, knee splitters, titty-scrapers and knives decorate this place. It
looks prepared to take on the next victim, which would have been you, but you escaped.


Running out the first door you see brings you into the hallway of Tormentilia. Is getting
Belladonna worth it now? All you want to do is get the fuck out of here. No, you must
find the herb, you must. No matter what. Have you done everything you set out to do in
this manor? Something is missing, and you will have to find some clothes because you're
stark naked. You're clothes were ripped after you turned. There are plenty of spare
bedrooms in this house to find a wardrobe, for clothes are the least of your worries. So,
now that you in Tormentilia, where will you go? Back to the crescent hall at the rear of

The light switch doesn't work so you rely on your mini flashlight to get down the stairs
safely. Once in the finished basement you flick the beam of light outward and spy what
looks like a winery. There must be over two hundred bottles stuffed in its own alcove.
There is also a table with six chairs around it, probably for the specific wine drinkers to
have a place to sit and chat. There are three doors down here. One is marked boiler room,
one laundry, and the other has no title. You also notice a plaque on the wall with many
hooks and dangling off these hooks are keys. They all look like identical brass keys
except for one which looks like polished steel. You take it, but you're unsure of what it
opens. Anyways, add STEEL KEY to your possessions.

You've seen strange things but none as strange as the scene before you. It is a room full
of dolls, clowns and miniature go-rounds. It appears to be a child's play area. As you step
in you also spy a few ugly looking dolls that could have passed off in some insane
voodoo ritual but possibly at one point they must have been a beloved toy. One doll
seems to be staring at you with its beady little eyes, its dress is made out of a potato sack
material and it is sewn together rather crudely with course black thread. Yes, a voodoo
doll, must be. You pick it up and examine it closely; some feeling about it makes you
want to cry. You are suddenly heartbroken and tears roll down your cheeks. A baby held
this doll at one time, a baby that has now either grown up or perished in this house at the
hands of the axe murderer. You cradle the doll and hold it close to your chest. Your eyes
close shut and you whimper heavily. Little do you know that this doll is cursed. Do you
wish to take it with you? Turn to 132. To put it down and leave this despicable room,

Finally back upstairs where there is light. Where will you go? You've arrived at the back

As you're hurrying up the path you arrive at a four-way junction. If you go right (turn to
146) if you go left (turn to 56) if you'd rather skip this then instead you head north.

You come into a massive clearing and can smell death in the air. It starts to rain as you
explore the surrounding area for an escape route. The rain stings your eyes and it tastes
slightly salty, you look up into the cloudy sky and see little red drops falling down all
around you. Licking your snout, you recognise the flavour of the rain and grasp the
concept that the nightly shower is pure blood. You're not sure to deduce if the blood rain,
the fog, or the silence capturing the region is eerie or natural. Then you hear footsteps,
but not from the south where you came from but the path off to the north. It sounds like
someone is not in any particular hurry and is dragging his feet. You wait, frozen,
wondering what it is; the scent in the atmosphere is morbid. Then she emerges finally and
it is a naked woman with torn flesh, her large tits are dangling by threads of skin, yellow
pus oozes from her orifices and down her legs. Her stare is vacant and the place where
her lips used to be is chewed away. You back up a bit and something grabs your hind leg,
an arm has come out of the wet soil, holding you in a vice grip. You watch as all around
as zombies pull themselves free from the blood soaked mud, no doubt the victims of the
axe murderer. Some are so decayed that their skin is black and ripping off them as they
rise out of their graves. The one who came out of the northern passage attacks you first
and with one backhand of your mighty claw you knock her head clean from her shoulders
but that doesn't stop the rest of her body from crawling in your direction. First, you bite
the hand that has you, separating it from its wrist. The zombie's blood has a gross tang,
even as a werewolf it's nasty. You're soon surrounded by the undead and must fight your
way out:

There are all kinds of cans of soup, beans and packages of pasta. The usual food items in
a standard household but you don't find any Belladonna. In the cupboards, you find a
spice rack full of sage, rosemary, basil and turmeric and another rack compiled of
Spikenard oil, Wormwood herb and Louisiana Van Van oils. You fumble through them
all viciously not caring what falls to the floor. You are desperate. There is nothing. You
may take any of the oils or herbs if you wish.

Fearing the next fall of night, you decide it's best to move out and continue your search
elsewhere. Return to 72.

No one comes to your cries for help and you have wasted your breath and time trying to
get rescued. Your skin bubbles viciously and your throat expands. Every swallow is like a
ferocious fire. The room starts spinning and in nervousness, you try to breathe the fresh
air coming in from under the doors. Your eyes melt out of their sockets and blood pours
from your nostrils. Spasms, puke and shit escape from your body and in seconds, you are

You are in the Bethel hall heading north towards the rear of the manor and on your
immediate right are two separate doors. To your left is a fancy balustrade, which
overlooks the indoor swimming pool below. Just as you're testing the doorknob of one of
the rooms the distinct sound of a chainsaw is heard off in the distance, it's coming from
farther back into the house. The chainsaw halts and silence deafens the corridors again.
Listening, nothing else happens, so you go back to what you were doing. The two doors
are named. The one you were trying to open is called Sardonyx, and listening at it reveals
no noise, perhaps it's safe to enter? The door further down is named Satyrion. Bethel
continues sometime north before splitting into a junction but you can't see that far, it's
too gloomy. Will you open Sardonyx (turn to 32) walk down to Satyrion and open that

You gouge out his Adam's apple to hush him. Because he fired his weapon, no doubt all
this noise has attracted his comrades and sure enough you hear them running down the
halls toward your place. You are stuck between the mini hall that is between Tormentilia

There are wrinkles all over your hands; in fact, your whole body has aged. It is

The front door is so close yet so far away but you race to it and open it. You are there, on
the outside, ringing the doorbell, unaware that the door has been opened. You try to touch
your double but an invisible wall prevents you from doing so. It's like the Twilight Zone
and slowly you back off. Seeing yourself outside on the porch, not knowledgeable of
what dangers await you inside, calling out to alert yourself or trying to escape through the
front door is pointless. Now you really want out of this house, so you grab an upholstered
chair, the heaviest one you can find and try to smash a window. The window shatters and
explodes throwing you off your feet and hurling you across the foyer. You head strikes
the bottom step of the massive stairwell and everything fades to black...

When you wake, you see that the door is closed, the window is intact, and the chair is
back in its place. You realise you might not be able to break out this house. Getting up
and massaging the bump on your scalp, you try the front door again; you're knocked off
your feet and flung across the room. Lose 1 STAMINA point. This is not going to work.
You must find that belladonna. There must be a way out of this mansion and trying the

Like some rabid dog you snap at her nose and rip it clean from her face, there's a pungent

the hole you made. Her howls are deafening and you're sure the militants who are still
after you can hear her. Quickly, you go for the ghoul's throat and bite deep, puncturing
her jugular, puncturing anything you viciously can to silence the creature. Oh, God, does
the blood taste horrid, not sweet like human blood, but just damn right stomach turning.
You might as well suck the juice out of an old trashcan, it's that bad. She falls limp and
slithers back into the pool. If you require female ghoul blood for any reason take a

kill you. If, however, you drank the tonic but are not infected with a plague then here
you die a most vicious death. If you are still alive and well again, great job in

Finally, the exit! You rush out into the backyard where there are gardens, trees, and you
vanish into the mist. When you reach the perimeter wall, you leap over it in a single
bound. Now the men hunting you will never find you. You are now in a great forest. You
cannot return to your car, you must stay in the woods until dawn breaks. Doesn't this
fucking suck? For a long time you wonder aimlessly through the trees, sniffing at the cool
breeze, the ground, hoping for a scent but find nothing of interest. Eventually you come
to a highway but it is an old possibly abandoned dirt road. It stretches into infinity both
ways. You're positive by following it will take you back to the main road, but you're not
sure, so you cross over it and re-enter the forest on the other side. You feel like some
tired brown bear who has just escaped death. Speaking of which, have you been bitten by
a monkey head? Perhaps you found a scroll with a concoction on it? If you were bitten by

There is nothing else written in the book that you can clearly read, everything else has
been violently scribbled over with a black marker or crayon. There are crude drawings of
ejaculating penises etched into the margins. You assume it must belong to the owner of
the manor, but surely not the axe murderer? He's been dead for ages now, you think.

Test your luck. If successful, turn to 63. Otherwise, a thorough search of the room
uncovers nothing else but a seating area and more books that will not assist you in your


problem. There must be a way to contact the owner of this house. Where is he? The

Wormwood is ok in Absinthe but in a concoction to rid yourself of Lycanthropy? It can't
do it alone. It needs a ton of help! You've nearly come close to a successful remedy, but
you have drunk the Wolfsbane in combination and have lethally poisoned yourself.
You're not sure what's worse as you lay on the floor writhing in misery � changing into a

This door is no match for you; you slam through like a bull in a Chinaware shop, and it

you are still being tracked. The maze is the only likely place of refuge and in a bounding
set of leaps head in that direction. There is gunfire at your heels as you do so. Lose 1

The room is a mix of science equipment and a library. There are astrological charts on the
walls, constellations, zodiac and strange sun and moon variations. Someone has crudely
drawn a red pentagram on the floor and surrounded it with black candles. You spy
telescopes of all sizes and world globes. Oddly, someone has scratched the hell out of the
globes leaving only Romania and Bulgaria intact. There are broken specimens of hairy
tarantulas and ugly over-sized beetles on the floor, it looks as though somebody got into a
raging fit and threw their precious collections on the ground. There is a small balcony
outside overlooking the backyard, and stairs, which lead up to a turret or tower of the
house, nothing of interest to you. Just as you're rummaging through the desks looking for
your cure someone from behind you puts a cloth over your nose and mouth, you smell the
distinct whiff of chloroform and in seconds, you're out...

When you come too, you're in a dark bare room, chained to a heavy table. A single light
bulb burns above you but its light is so pathetic you can't see anything lurking in the
corners. There is a single doorway to your left but no illumination is coming from it. A
person walks in, a tall man, wearing dirty grey coveralls and a leather mask. You've seen


enough horror movies to know this is probably not a good thing. He is carrying a pair of
sharp pliers in his rubber-gloved hand, you're not quite sure, but it looks like it.

You ask him what he wants.

Quickly without saying a word, he grabs your pinkie and cuts it off at the joint with the
pliers. You swear you heard him chuckle, but it could just be heavy breathing. In tears,
you ask him again what he wants and he leaves the room. Your finger is screaming
bloody murder and blood is raging out. He comes back with a chainsaw and starts it up,
you holler at him to stop and he presses the spinning teeth of the saw into your left ankle
until your foot only partially comes off. He just wanted to see your blood squirt fiercely
into the air; he wants to hear you scream. With such pain, something begins to happen to
you, you begin to feel that you are transforming. It had to come at such a torrent hour,
such a depraved moment, but you are turning into a werewolf again! He backs off,
watches you `turn' and in anger you break your bonds and attack him!

You don't realise it but you have fallen asleep after your nightly excursion, when you
wake, the sun has illuminated the morning haze, light pours weakly through the trees.
What is more you are human again. Naked. But human. It's good to see your hands rather
than the claws of a dangerous monster. Have you been cursed by a program on a
computer? If you were you were told that you must do something, that you must have

Lose 1 STAMINA point. Now that you're bleeding and sore, you wipe the sticky blood
from your eyes and scan the room. It is a very large bedchamber, which looks fit only for
royalty or some really spoiled rich fuck. There is a terrace behind the French doors,
which overlooks a great flowery Zen garden. You rummage through the dressers and
closets but find nothing but perfumes, designer clothing and a whopping collection of
men's shoes. There are jewellery boxes filled with diamond rings, pearl necklaces and
gold bangles. You could steal this but your next `turn' really worries you, will you wear
the pearl necklace while you're a werewolf out looking to maim your next victim? How
pretty you'd look wearing something that was once a product in a filthy oyster's cavity.
Another painful search of this room finds a strange jade talisman. You're not sure if it's
safe to put on or not, for it could be cursed for all you know, so make a note if you decide
to wear this thing or not. There is a door by the bed but it is locked. It is possible this
leads to Satyrion. Now it's time to leave the room.

Return to Bethel. Turn to 125.

It's hard to see through the haze, you're certain you are lost now. You see a pair of
glowing white eyes ahead and pause in your tracks. What the hell is that? They dart about
from the ground to the top of the hedge wall. An animal perhaps? Then they all but
disappear, so you continue onward for a couple more metres. A passage appears on your
immediate right but it is too foggy to see what is down it. Also, you can continue walking
along the path you're on.

Will you keep going straight (turn to 38) turn right down the new path (turn to 99) or

In desperation, you knock all the books from their shelves hoping to find a hidden door
and smash the main doors with a chair to no avail, for these doors are heavy and cannot
be bullied open. Each second you waste and each option you choose next costs you 4

The path comes to a dead end but you do find a bush where stamina empowered berries
grows all over it. Eating these will grant you 4 stamina points. Lucky find. You return to
the four-way junction. If you go straight (turn to 56) if you'd rather skip this then instead
you head north. Read on...

You come into a massive clearing and can smell death in the air. It starts to rain as you
explore the surrounding area for an escape route. The rain stings your eyes and it tastes
slightly salty, you look up into the cloudy sky and see little red drops falling down all
around you. Licking your snout, you recognise the flavour of the rain and grasp the
concept that the nightly shower is pure blood. The fog is eerie and a silence captures the
region. Then you hear footsteps, but not from the south where you came from but the
path off to the north. It sounds like someone is not in any particular hurry and is dragging
his feet. You wait, frozen, wondering what it is; the scent in the atmosphere is morbid.
Then she emerges finally and it is a naked woman with torn flesh, her large tits are
dangling by threads of skin, yellow pus oozes from her orifices and down her legs. Her
stare is vacant and the place where her lips used to be is chewed away. You back up a bit
and something grabs your hind leg, an arm has come out of the wet soil and has you in a
vice grip. You watch as all around you zombies pull themselves free from the blood
soaked mud, no doubt the victims of the axe murderer. Some are so decayed that their
skin is black and ripping off them as they rise out of their graves. The one who came out
of the northern passage attacks you first and with one backhand of your mighty claw you
knock her head clean from her shoulders but that doesn't stop the rest of her body from
crawling in your direction. First, you bite the hand that has you, separating it from its
wrist. The zombie's blood has a gross tang, even as a werewolf this is nasty. You're soon
surrounded by the undead and must fight your way out:

There are only two doors on your immediate left and they are both locked. To your right
is a balcony overlooking the pool below. The corridor comes to an end eventually. You
see a seating area to your right within a hall that links up to Bethel. You could rest your
tired limbs here in one of the chairs but you will not gain any stamina. There is a narrow
hall ahead. Will you go into the narrow hall (turn to 160) head east (turn to 194) walk

Well, they don't smell like anything special, just porcelain and mildew. Just as you're
licking your snout the other gnome springs to life and climbs up on top of the bench.
Without any warning he throws a handful of colourful glitter in your face. For a second
your vision is blurred but when you come to both gnomes have vanished. Little do you
know they have cursed you with DUMB STRUCK and now you will fail one round of
testing your WEREWOLF PROWESS when asked because you're so stupid in thinking
things through now. Yes, dumb struck, how could you be so silly and trust garden
gnomes? So make a note that when you're asked to test your WEREWOLF PROWESS you
will be unsuccessful just once. This could be the peril of life or death for you, so be
careful. There's nothing else here, unless you still want to see what's in the pool? Turn to

in (turn to 43).

You can hear the howling of dogs out there amidst the shrubs and hedges. Somewhere
out there, there are guard dogs. Also, the sun is setting. The sky is a tint of orange,
lavender and pink with a few puffy white clouds hovering by. You try the door handle
and oddly find it locked. You spy a stone staircase outside coming down from above,
perhaps if you go upstairs you can then use this stairwell in coming down? You have a
gut instinct about the backyard and then it becomes obvious to your sight. Something is
flickering in the sunlight, next to the fountain. There is nothing else in this area, you must
return to 11.

It doesn't release its hold and tugs back with such force your ears rip clean from your
head. Pain and blood becomes your friend and quickly you move away from the ghoul. It
stalks you, stepping out of the pool on bony gnarled excuses for feet, and stuffs your ears
into its black yap. It moans in pleasure as it savours every bite. Not knowing where
you're going and disorientated now from the sting you flee down any passage you come
across. Each time you come to a dead end, it finds you and swipes with its hand, but you
swing back and it mocks your efforts. You're losing a lot of blood and there's a ringing
where your ears should be. Then you feel your legs and front legs start to grow weak. The
toxins of the ghoul are taking effect inside your body from when it clawed at you earlier.
It eventually catches up after having followed the scent trail of your leaking blood.


You're exhausted, you can't run anymore, all you can do now is lie down on the path and
await your doom.

&quot;Mmm, yes,&quot; it gloats and kneels down beside you. Its pea green eyes are wide with
excitement and it even dances its fingers in the air knowing they will soon be tearing into
your skin. You wish you can just fall asleep right now and forget this experience, but you
are still wide awake, you just can't fucking move a muscle. You look away as you feel
the first razor sharp pinch of teeth in your backside. You're not sure what sickens you the
most � the groaning of delight as the ghoul engorges itself, or the insane torture your
every nerve feels as you're being eaten alive.

Set in motion, completely ignoring, men and women dressed in period apparel from the
mid 19 century are in the middle of some dance or waltz. But their skin is rotted away or
        th

stiff and russet like leather. You are in the midst of a zombie party and the smell in here
is rancid as hell. It's a scene out of a Jane Austin novel. Their clothing has absorbed their
rigor mortis stench and every time one flows by you, it leaves a lasting impression on
your heightened sense of smell. They are dancing to the tune of the piano. All of the
lights in this room have turned on now and the curtains fall from the windows. The doors
you came through close shut and lock. The piano stops bellowing out its inferior tunes
and the zombies bring their dance to an end. Then their head turn slowly in your
direction. You've seen Dawn of the Dead, Return of the living Dead and 28 Days Later.
Surely you're shitting in your pants right now. You step backwards cautiously and reach
behind you, not taking your eyes off these things, and jiggle the door handle but it is
definitely locked. So, acting like you belong there, you cautiously walk through them and
they step aside as you do so. Your heart is pounding, your stomach is wretched, and the
doors on the far end of the room you are making for are getting closer. One zombie opens
its mouth and gasps in an elongated yawn, and you can smell its foul breath in your face.
They are getting nearer to your presence to get a closer look at you; it appears by this that
your welcome is drawing to a close. One angrily grabs your shoulder and your heart
nearly jumps free from your chest!

Test your SKILL. Will you be fast enough to escape before they are all on top of you, or
will you be maimed alive? They start to groan and howl and with you fighting for your
life to get out of there, your clothing is ripped as they claw their way to your flesh. If you
were triumphant in testing your skill score, then turn to 46. If you have failed this then
you will not escape the onslaught of these mindless beings. Yes, they rip you limb from
limb with an intense violence you never thought possible, yes, your torso is all that's left,
indeed, and they waste no time slashing into it and yanking out your organs like the
gluttonous monsters that they are. Then they rip your head off, break open your skull, and
fight over who is to have your brain.

A bullet grazes your upper arm as you wrench the +4 AXE free. Lose 2 STAMINA points.
In minutes, you are alone again and thankfully, he doesn't come after you. For some time
you trudge on through the bush, thinking maybe it's time to find the old dirt road you
crossed over in the night. Just as you're checking the contents in your backpack you hear
the distinct crude noise of a chainsaw behind you, glancing over your shoulder, your
heart takes a leap. It is the crazed ghost from Crimson Manor, and he has found you. He
still looks like a vaporous spectre even in the morning hours. You decide to risk
everything and take a chance. You throw the axe as hard as you can, hoping it will take a
swinging action in mid-air as it flies toward its target. The axe does just that and embeds
deep into the ghost's forehead. He drops the chainsaw and it disappears. He falls to his
knees, blood spills from his mouth, or at least you think its blood. He vanishes and the
axe falls to the ground. You're not sure why this is happening but by destroying the

&quot;Ah fuck, missed!&quot; He clamours and threatens you again. You can hear the men yelling
from in the distance and the ghost smiles, &quot;You won't be running away this time, I'll
keep you here, just for them.&quot;

He comes nearer but every time you back away. You can't take on the ghost and your

You're not sure this is the right thing to do but quickly you pop it into your mouth and
start chewing it. The damn thing tastes bitter sweet and it's repulsive but you swallow it
and wait. In a few seconds you can hear pitter patter of paws running violently through
the maze ahead. You're not sure what you're hearing. Then a pain hits your gut and it
forces you to keel over. Belladonna is highly toxic and you've eaten too much, there
must've been something you were supposed to do with it? Saliva drips from your mouth
and the ache in your belly gets worse, you think you may even black out. Then you see
them, yes, big black dogs, many of them charging from the maze and they're pissed.
When they arrive they waste no time mauling you, you're dragged all over, bitten,

Like some trapped mouse escaping from its predator, you take a single bound over the
railing, plummet from the second floor, and down into the cold pool below. There is a
mighty splash and you sink halfway to the bottom. You swim frantically back to the
surface and pull yourself out.

&quot;He's in the pool!&quot; Someone shouts, and then insane gunfire. They bounce off the pillars
and floor all around you as you scamper to wherever there might be safety. Will you run

There are two doors on the left and one on the right. The first door is leads into a broom
closet. Need a weapon? A good sturdy mop or broom might do (each is +1 but they will
break after one hit to the skull). The second door is labelled nursery, to go to this door,
turn to 22. And the other door on the right is only a filthy bed chamber. There is nothing
else in this hall so you follow it and eventually it veers to the east. There are more doors
and mini halls in this segment of the house. It appears that this narrow hall is just a
crescent-shaped corridor, which links up with Bethel and Tormentilia. This semi-circular

It is a creature of the dark; you cannot harm it because it is not of this world. It does not
have a stamina score or a skill level. The men laugh at your feeble attempts or are they
laughing because they know you could never defeat such a demon? So why even try? The
demon grabs you like a rag doll by your throat. You can see what hell looks like through
its eyes, hell is reflected as an aggressive place full of violent behaviour, murder,
abnormal sex and bloody gore, and you can even smell rotten eggs, the rising sulphur of
the eternal fires coming out of its nostrils. Its grip on you is so tight you wish for release
or death. It will not release you, however, that option is not available. In its claw you
struggle to breathe, you look like a little guilty puppy in the vice of some malicious killer
owner. The demon breathes on you and its breath is so foul it burns your eyes until you're
blinded. Then it takes its other hand and grasps you around your chest, that is when the
torment starts, for you can feel your innards pushing up through your throat, blood, air,
life, all escaping from your body in such a sadistic occurrence. Your adventure is over.

He senses your coyness and chuckles. He even throws his hat in your face to get you to
attack but you just won't. You're waiting for him to make the first move but he doesn't
really do anything to excite your rage. Something small rolls into the clearing between
you two and explodes into a cloud of smoke. The whole area is afflicted with tear gas and
that man seems to have made his departure. Four armed men charge into the clearing
wearing their gas masks. Will you escape or will they see you? Test your WEREWOLF

So, you know that these slots act as the door's locking mechanism. To open it, all you
need do is insert the correct dog tags. Add up the total of four of your dog tags and turn to
that reference. If you come to a section that doesn't make sense then a dart, which came
out of the door, has poisoned you ending your adventure. Don't have all the dog tags

pimples and bloody vomit. Before your innards start turning to mush, you quickly
rummage through the desks; your flashlight is your only source of light. Expired
toiletries, junk drawers, even an arts and crafts drawer, but no Belladonna. But you do
find a small SILVER WHISTLE. Adding that to your possessions, you're about to rush out
back into the hallway when the clawed tub comes to life and blocks your way. It whips
you with its shower hose! If you have a pickaxe, you will deal much damage to this
abomination. Otherwise, you will have to find a way to outsmart it so you can make your
escape. To do this you must test your luck every time it's your turn in the fight. If you are

When you stop, the ghost stops. You both stare at one another and he grins, &quot;Let's see if
you're smart as a dog than when you were as a human? You may have done away with
all of my plans to thwart you, but it was fun while it lasted; now I can safely kill you.
There is no cure in this house for your cause, you are doomed to your existence, when I
found out you were coming I set everything up nicely. You haven't met my old friend the
axe murderer yet, have ya? Do you honestly know who it could be? The mystery will kill
you.&quot;

You growl, your eyes glow a vibrant cherry rose, and saliva drips from your fangs.

&quot;Don't growl at me, what you really should be worried about are those werewolf slayers I
called in. They're a bunch of teenagers who will work for next to nothing, a few bucks so
they can buy smokes, drugs and booze. They're here now, go on, I dare ya to go looking
for them. You won't be leaving out the front door either to escape; I've got it guarded
rather heavily.&quot;

The chainsaw is still sputtering but not screaming it raggedy tune.

&quot;Unless, you want to die now? Oh, I really don't want you to expire like this, it's too
easy, and I want those kids to get ya. Yes, that'll be exciting to watch and I think it'll be
good for them to get a kick out of ending your miserable life.&quot;

Yes, there is definitely something in the room beyond and you are not mistaken. Quietly
you tiptoe to the French doors and open them a crack so you can peak in. It appears to be
some room laden with vines, red roses and thorns. The windows are spray painted black
making it gloomy as hell in there. There are a few metal chairs strewn about. The door
slams shut in your face and there is an ear-splitting howl! The doors are blown off their
hinges sending you and the bits of wood to the ground. A ghostly figure with tattered
robes emerges. It aura is glowing in the darkness a hue of blue and white and it is not
human. You can make out its skeletal claws and skull for a face. You're not sure how to
react since you have nothing to defend yourself with against a Wraith.

You've never felt so much fear and now would be a good time to `turn' but night hasn't
arrived yet. If you have a sharp silver object with you, you just might get out of this
situation alive. If you do have a silver object, turn to 105. If not, the Wraith chases you
down and when it finally corners you, it rips your soul clean from your body. As this is

out of harms way and fires upon you, calling for his cohort as he does so. Soon you are in
a rain of bullets and they effectively gun you down in Tormentilia Hall. If you succeed,
you quickly dispatch this enemy by biting out his throat and drag him into your hiding
spot. Now you wait for the other person...

He comes out of the room he was in and calls out to his buddy and you can sense his
worry when his friend doesn't reply. You wait, hoping to get this one too in a stealthy

So far, you've been in the west wing of the crescent. If you wish to remain in the crescent
hall, what doors and sections, will you investigate? Most of the doors here lead to guest
bedchambers that do not interest you. The first door in the east wing is the house's
Turkish bath, a very elegant custom room full of cobalt and turquoise mosaic tiling.
Stepping in to get a better look you flick on the light switch and check around. All you
find is a duck made of ivory with ruby eyes. You can keep this if you like. The second
door is labelled `study' but there appears to be a strange set of four slim slots above the
handle. If you know what to do here, turn to that reference now. There is a door opposite
of these rooms, which leads into an old fancy bedchamber with nothing of value. The last
door is locked; it looks like someone had melted the lock. This is about it, and then this

torso clean away and it slithers free, blood and guts splatter everywhere and with her
corpse still dangling off its behind the insect is looking for something to eat now. It snaps

The door is slightly jammed but you mange to push it open using the force of your
shoulder. The room looks like any other furnace room. You step in to see if you can find
anything useful; in a tool box you find a heavy wrench, so in case you ever stumble
across something you can defend yourself. You find a paper on the wall with the
portcullis code +20 +20 -10. Making a note of this code, you decide what else to do
when...

There is a whoosh of fire and the whole room lights up, no, it's not the furnace it's
coming from behind you. In a daze and caught off guard you spin on your heel and see
some odd creature resting on the ceiling by the door, blocking your way back out. It is
made of fire, but beneath the fiery aura is a chubby humanoid frame. Its wings are made
entirely out of flames. It explodes, sending you flying backward, and when you come to
you're in a raging inferno! The creature is still alive, it attacks you, chasing you all
around the place, and every time you lose an attack round it explodes causing great burns
on your skin. Every time it gets you in a winning combat you will lose an extra 4
STAMINA points. A jet of fire comes out of its mouth and eyes, this almost liquid stream
does not care what it destroys, and it just hopes to get you in the blast. During its pauses
to rejuvenate, this is when you strike.

Just as you suspected, old potions with corks, shaman masks and all kinds of weird things
like vials full of menstrual blood, semen and snake's venom. There are also candles in the
shape of animals and gender candles. You find photos of strangers with their face
offensively scratched out as if by a knife, there are boxes full of sachets used in cursing
and curious little dolls with pins sticking out of them. There are brass incense holders and
by the smell of some of the sticks and cones you make out the incense in them to be
cedar. On the other shelves you find a ziplock bag full of dried pigeon shit, graveyard
dust from a child's grave and all kinds of books on spellcasting hexes where the caster
can emit spells to cause trouble, invoke harm, or even kill an enemy. There are dusty,
labelled jars full of tobacco, collected black widow spiderwebs, Four Thieves vinegar and
hair belonging to felines and canines. There is too much in here, you can't take it all in,
and you feel a little awkward snooping. Then you see a strange scroll and it has a recipe
called Black Plague Tonic. Were you bitten by a monkey head? This tonic might be just
for you, if you trust it.

              Mix equal parts of Spikenard Oil, Calamus Root, and the
              blood of a female Ghoul in a rose gold chalice


               You'll know you mixed it correctly when the liquid turns
               white and starts to curdle on top

You suddenly notice that there is a skull and crossbones on the bottom of the scroll
indicating the tonic is noxious. Now the idea of ingesting this may not be such a good
idea after all. You don't want to kill yourself. You recall that Workplace Hazardous
Material Information System course you took and the skull with cross bones will kill you
if you drink it. But you don't need a silly course to tell you what to drink and what not to
drink. Right? Now, there is nothing else in here, so you return to the hallway. Will you

The water is frigid when you test it with your hand, but that won't stop you. You lower
yourself in, bring your head underwater and swim down to get the pickaxe. As you're
doing so a gush of red forms all around you then something grabs hold of your neck and
begins to choke you out. You're not sure what's attacking you and you struggle to break
to the surface. You can see bubbles escaping from your mouth, ascending high toward the

its eyelids. It is the face of a young woman, her dark eyes are angry and her teeth are
stained brown. You're not quite sure but you think you can almost see right through her.
Then you break free and notice as you start to run out of breath that the lower half of her
body is missing, blood is leaching out of her dismembered torso, and you can taste all of
it. It's getting into your nostrils, clouding your vision and suffocating you. Will you still

that this might perhaps hold the key to your escape. You push it, hit it and shake it but
nothing happens. Then slowly you push the head and it partially separates at the neck

move aside. Quickly, you race towards it and run down a stone descending stairwell. You

benches and dried blood smeared across the walls. There is a heavy portcullis barring

Outside, a dank fog is hovering on the ground, bullets whiz by and your only refuge is the
maze. Your pursuers won't find you in there but if they follow you you will be ready. A
duvet of clouds block out the moon and navy starlit sky as you push deeper into the


towering hedge labyrinth. For some time, you go left, right and left again, sniffing the air,
clawing your way to safer ground in a craze. You feel like a futile hound, a precious
breed, hunted by poachers. They should fear you like in most folklore but they don't. The
narrow path soon opens up into a clearing where a fountain is situated in its center. If you
need stamina, you can lap up the chilly water but it will only restore 4 points. You lick
your wounds and rest for a second. The fountain is of a maiden holding onto a rose gold
chalice, it reminds you of the Queen of Cups in some Ciro tarot set. You can take the
chalice if you wish. Although you are a werewolf now and have torn your clothes, you
still have your backpack. No items you may have collected during your adventure have

The door opens without a squeak and you let yourself into a polished lush room complete

spellbooks, New Age collections, dragon magick and devil worship. There are open
journals and photographs all over the desktop, and a fancy calligraphy pen writing all by

Then the words vanish, the black ink lifts up off the paper. You take the pen in your
fingers and it zaps you! You drop it and then notice that the photos on the desk are rather
interesting. Taking one up to view it, it is of a person lying on the floor, possibly one of
the rooms of the mansion? Getting a closer look reveals that the person is face down in a
manner of that of a murdered victim. There is blood all over the floor around the corpse
and a bloodied axe in the victim's grasp. You go through the other pictures quickly and
begin to realise to your shock that that person is you. You're the deceased person in the
pics. You can't make out exactly what room you're in, or why you have an axe, or who
or what killed you... Your heart is beating fast now and sweat is trickling down your
temples, this room is getting overly warm. The blinds flick open and the moonlight
comes in, there is a pain all over your body and you drop the photographs.

Falling to one knee, your fingernails grow longer, splitting your fingertips and blood
purges out. Your skin cracks open all over and course black fur grows out of those
fractures. Something clogs your throat and your skull is separating into two. In agony,
you whimper and search the room frantically, for it is happening again. You are
becoming a creature of the night. In a cabinet, you find a bottle of Wolfsbane. But what
will you do with it? Will you mix it with something you picked up in the mansion? If so,
what will that be?

Mix with both Belladonna and Wormwood herb, turn to 85.
Mix with just Belladonna, turn to 10.
Mix with just Wormwood herb, turn to 136.

If you don't know what to do, will you drink the Wolfsbane on its own? Turn to 67.

He disappears and you step into the painting. You are in a dark forest with only the moon
to light the area; luckily you don't turn into a werewolf. Why? Because it's not real. You
feel tired now and lie down in the exact same spot the man was earlier, resting your back
against the shoots. Then you can see the gallery, you can actually view the room from
where you are. You are a part of the painting now, and the warrior is standing where you
once were. He smiles and starts to laugh mockingly but you can't hear him. Then he
waves once and leaves the gallery. There is a sudden pain in your spine but you can't
move, and in horror you watch as a tube of bamboo grows out through your stomach.
You can barely breathe now. This will be the picture from now on, you, holding onto a
bamboo shoot as it grows out of you. Who knows what the next person will think of your
painting. But it doesn't matter, you're frozen in time, and left to suffer. In time, someone
may buy the painting of you at an auction, or it will get destroyed by a fire, nonetheless,
your adventure is over.

If you've been in here before you already know what's about, and since you've
previously acquired Belladonna, you don't need to look for it. If you haven't been in here
prior the room is a mix of science equipment and a library. There are astrological charts
on the walls, constellations, zodiac and strange sun and moon variations. You spy
telescopes of all sizes and world globes. Oddly, someone has scratched the hell out of the
globes leaving only Romania and Bulgaria intact. There are broken specimens of hairy
tarantulas and ugly over-sized beetles on the floor, it looks as though somebody got into a
raging fit and threw their precious collections on the ground. There is a weird drawing of
a red pentagram on the floor surrounded by black candles. There is a small balcony
outside overlooking the backyard, and stairs, which lead up to a turret or tower of the
house. But it is dark in here so it's difficult to make out much more stuff.

You find a safe place to hide under a table as the guys looking for your hide walk about
outside in the hall talking quietly to each other. One comes into the room and stands at
the door surveying his surroundings, and you dare not breathe. Then to your dislike, he
strolls in and starts fiddling with things on tabletops even knocking over a glass tube on
the floor. It spews a cloud of acidic vapours and this fills up your nostrils. Test your
WEREWOLF PROWESS. Can you hold your breath and ignore the fumes burning your
snout or will you gasp and choke? If you failed, he jumps to one side and aims his gun
toward your hiding spot. Turn to 58. If you were successful, he leaves the room. Turn to
75.

With all your might you swing this item as hard as you can and smash it into the big
aquarium! The glass explodes and all of its water comes gushing out, then blood, then
body parts. A hacked up human lies at your feet; you spy a foot, a torso, a leg, and an
arm. All the body parts of a woman. You're starting to feel a little dizzy, and then you
hear the reckless noise of a chainsaw. Quickly you grab the BRASS KEY and put it in
your pocket. Quickly, you open the door to the room you're currently in and warily peek


out, but the sound has stopped. You swear it came from upstairs. Wondering if it's even
wise to stay in this house any longer you step softly back out into the foyer. Return to 35.

You are now at the junction of Bethel and a narrow hallway. To go south down Bethel
(turn to 158) to go into the narrow corridor (turn to 196).

You have no choice; you're being pushed backwards into the crescent shaped hall. You
can't go down Tormentilia or Bethel, men are racing up that way and they do find their
dead cohorts. Now they know you're up here. Where will you go? Down one of the
servant's stairs to the main floor (turn to 166) out the rear door and into the backyard
(turn to 188) stand your ground a fight your pursuers (turn to 24)?

The first door is locked; it looks like someone had melted the lock. The second door is
labelled `study' but there appears to be a strange set of four slim slots above the handle. If
you know what to do here, turn to that reference now.

There is a door on the left of the room but it leads into an old dusty bedchamber with
nothing of value. Further down is the house's Turkish bath, a very elegant custom room
full of cobalt and turquoise mosaic tiling. Stepping in to get a better look you flick on the
light switch and check around. All you find is a duck made of ivory with ruby eyes. You
can keep this if you like. There is nothing else in this hall so you follow it and eventually
it veers to the west. There are more doors and mini halls in this segment of the house. It
appears that this narrow hall is just a crescent-shaped corridor, which links up to Bethel
and Tormentilia. This semi-circular hall has many places for you to explore. So far,
you've been in the east wing of the crescent and fond an ivory duck in the Turkish bath.
If you wish to remain in the crescent hall, what doors and sections, will you investigate?

The gallery, turn to 33.
The observatory, turn to 138.
The rear door of the house, turn to 44.
Go down one of the servant stairwells back to the main floor, turn to 11.
Enter the room of dolls, turn to 114.
Enter the nursery, turn to 22.

Go to Bethel hall, turn to 158.
Go to Tormentilia hall, turn to 23.

Most of the doors here lead to guest bedchambers that do not interest you.

There are too many of them and you will have to make a hasty decision. Will you jump
over the balcony and into the pool below (turn to 159) or bolt into the crescent hall (turn
to 100)?

The door creaks disgustingly on its rusty hinges probably startling what creatures stir
within the next room. You open the door wide and peer into what appears to be the
kitchen and there are three abominations in here far from the birdlike expectations you
had earlier. One is up on the counters, while the other two are on the floor. Their eyes are
glowing red, their skin grey like slate, and their spine is curved and protruding from their
back like some Jurassic plate of armour. They're not humanoids, they seem reptilian, and
upon your intrusion they abandon their meal, which is the swollen mangled corpse of a
woman. The smell in this room causes you to gag, so much so, you're thinking on closing
this door again and letting these ghouls do their business. The kitchen is painted with
blood from the things gouging at the body and possibly fighting over it. When they see
you they let out a wail and charge for the door. You close it quickly and back away as the
door rattles violently and the creatures scratch and claw. Fortunately, they don't use the
doorknob. In seconds, the noise stops and for a moment you feel safe. Maybe the
Belladonna herb is in the kitchen with all those spices? If you have some sort of weapon,
you could go back in there and kill the ghouls? If you don't have a weapon you can rely
on your trusty fists.

What do you want to do? Rush into the kitchen and start fighting (turn to 83) or ignore
this room and explore elsewhere (turn to 72)?

Stuck in motion, frozen in time, men and women dressed in period apparel from the mid
19 century are in the middle of some dance. But their skin is rotted off or rigid and
  th

brown like leather. You are in the midst of a zombie party but thankfully, none makes a
move. Quietly and carefully, you examine the room, turning on your flashlight. On one of
the banquet tables is the head of a young man and it is still fresh, his blood is dripping all
over the floor. Silver bowls of fruit are spoiled, meats are rancid and the cake and breads
are mouldy. You find a +2 butcher knife; you may take this if you need a weapon.
There are doors on the opposite end of the room so you take them and find yourself back
in the main foyer. The double doors are locked again; it appears they can only be opened
from in the inside. Return to 35.

The dirt road is a Godsend, it is so welcoming and for such a long time you follow it
south, your heart is beating in anticipation that you might run into your enemies. Then
you hear the sound of tires rolling along the road and quickly you dash behind a tree. It's


not what you expected; in fact it's a beat up pickup truck. You take the chance and hail
him down and fortunately, he pulls over. He rolls down the passenger side window, you
tell him your story, leaving the werewolf part out of it, and he invites you into his vehicle.
It is a long ride home and he even loans you a pair of coveralls. The highway only brings
back bad memories and he says very little to you, he drops you off in front of your home
and drives away. When you go into your house, you shower, call your boss, and slump
over on your bed and sleep for hours. You're jolted awake by your cell phone, it is the
lady from the occult store. You tell her what happened and she says she is phoning the
police.

With the police, you return to Crimson Manor, and your car is still parked in the
driveway, no one has touched it. You have already given your full report to the cops and
with guns ready, they enter the manor. You expect to hear shots but they come out calm
as ever, looking at your befuddled.

&quot;You better take a look inside,&quot; one tells you.

You quickly hurry to the front door, not really wanting to experience this place again and
see a strange sight. The whole foyer is in a state of disrepair, as if it hadn't been touched
in decades. The marble is cracked, the chandelier is on the floor in pieces, the windows
are dusty and some shattered by vandalism. All of the doors are broken or spray-painted
with graffiti. It looks as though teenagers had come in here often to party or maybe even
squatters made it a home. The floor is charred appearing as if someone used it to light fire
pits on it. In other words, the Crimson Manor does not look like it did when you first
arrived and the police are upset that you would give them false reports.

The mansion is not lived in, hasn't been occupied since the murders, no one likes coming
here; it is unsettled with many bad spirits say most paranormal investigators. The police
leave you be and tell you to go home and never come back here and to stop making up
stories. They assume you were drunk and had an unusual experience but nothing they can
do anything about. When they go, you stand there on the porch and take in your
surroundings. The yard is not even kept like before; it is overgrown with weeds and
polluted with garbage.

You get back in your car and start the engine, you're no longer a werewolf and what
happened in Crimson Manor is just a myth to everyone else. You know what happened to
you but you can't explain it. Always in the back of your mind you will feel something is
calling you there, always you will feel people are after you, always you will be a part of
that place because you have left a portion of yourself in it. From this day on you will
always have nightmares about Crimson Manor, its devils beckon your return, but return
you never will.

As you drive down the dirt road, the house starts to grow smaller and smaller in your rear
view mirror, little do you know that in the back seat of your car is a passenger. A clown
doll with an evil expression on his white powdery face; he is smirking, knowing full well


that you are unsuspectingly bringing him home. Once again, you are afflicted with
another curse.
