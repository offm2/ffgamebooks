		echo "<p>You are a lawyer by trade, although you have previous training as part of Salamonis vast
army which means you know how to handle a blade should the need ever arise and, even
after ten years in the legal business, you still always make certain to carry a short sword
just in case you should need to defend yourself in the unsafe streets of Allansia's
townships.</p><br>";
echo "<p>Nowadays though, you much prefer the minutiae and detail (not to mention the relatively
safe and lucrative nature) of legal bureaucracy and, only a fortnight ago, an interesting
case was presented to you by the cherva who acts as your personal assistant. As a result,
you have sought passage on a merchant ship from Allansia to the Old World , a journey
that has taken the best part of the past two weeks and, you have noted in your journal,
you cannot help feeling a sensation of having travelled from the West of Titan to the East
as there are noticeable differences in both the land and the peoples of the Old World.</p><br>";
echo "<p>The case is that of twin sisters Ingrid and Angharad Heydrich, who have lately inherited a
run-down castle and its grounds in Mortvania, the region where, several generations ago,
the Heydrich family is said to originally hail from. The deeds for the castle are very
limited in their content, giving little indication of its having ever served any real purpose
as a seat of power or defence. No names of previous owners are listed and this seems
very odd to your thorough legal mind, although there is a detailed plan of the building's
footprint and its adjoining land, plus there is a sketch of how grand the building must
once have been. The only documentation attached to suggest any former inhabitants is
heavily defaced, the edges singed as if it may once have been saved from a fire. Indeed,
amongst the scant records is a yellowed bill poster telling (in an almost celebratory tone)
of how the castle was finally put to the torch ending 'once and for all' the 'evil that
resided there'. You cannot help smiling at the luridness of this description and reflect on
how superstitious people were only a century or so ago. You know little of Mortvania
yourself, it being a very remote area to the North that you have never had cause to visit
until now, although you have heard old wives tales and stories from those who have
ventured that far North of how, even now, the locals, especially the older generations,
cross themselves whenever the ruined castle is mentioned.</p>";
echo "<p>You have received word by letter that the twins intend to meet you at an inn close to the
castle, from whence you intend to travel together to view the remains of the building
itself, followed by your formally handing-over ownership to them. This should be a fairly
routine conveyancing task for which you will charge your usually extortionate fee of 500
Gold Pieces. You anticipate that the entire case will take you no more than three days
work, which is how long you have taken a room at the inn for. You pack the relevant
documents and take a mailcoach North to rendez-vous at the inn at the agreed time.</p>";
echo "<p>It is a full day's ride to reach your destination, so you take the opportunity to re-read the
deeds and plans of the castle. You doubt there will be any scope to renovate the building
without huge financial outlay, but the land that it comes with could be exploited for
growing crops. You are about to fold the papers and return them to your leather satchel
when a small folded piece of paper catches your eye in the bottom of your bag. You
surmise that this must have been amongst the damaged documents and had slipped out as
you withdrew them. From the discolouration and staining you guess that this paper is
rather older than the rest and little is decipherable other than the name Siegfried which
appears several times. The mailcoach suddenly lurches to the left and you feel it come to
a halt. The driver opens the door, lowers the iron access step, and offers you his hand to
help you down. You fold the papers away hurriedly and take the driver's hand as you step
from the coach. Night has already fallen and a heavy fog is descending that prevents you
from seeing very far and you cannot distinguish anything other than the glow of an oil
lamp that shines over the main entrance to the inn, its light piercing through the fog,
casting weird shadows as the flame flickers. You take a quick look around as you take the
few strides to the entrance and you are convinced that you can make out the glossy sheen
of a pair of silver lupine eyes in the fog beyond the coach. You tell yourself that this is
merely the lamplight reflecting in the moist air and pass through the entrance into the inn
where the twins are sat waiting for you at a table close to the door.</p>";
