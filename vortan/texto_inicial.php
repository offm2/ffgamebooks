		echo "<p>Vortan, The Snake Lord. The name alone is enough to strike fear into all but the most
daring (or suicidal) of adventurers. Rarely is he seen, but his foul Vipermen offspring,
having reached their adolescent stage, emerge annually from deep within the sands of the
Desert of Skulls to pillage and plunder the few pockets of civilisation that they can find
dotted about the huge desert expanse. Primary amongst their targets are the numerous
trains of traders caravans that pass through the region, unwittingly providing food and
precious plunder with which to line the Vipermen's hidden sandy nests that they retreat to
at sundown before the sands grow bitterly cold and the lethal nightly dust storms begin to
rage.</p><br>";
echo "<p>A year ago, a victim of one of these random attacks was none other than your own father
and you have vowed to avenge his death by tracking down the Snake Lord and destroying
him, thus ending his blight once and for all. You have spent the past year gathering the
scant evidence that you can find to indicate the location of the Snake Lord's hidden
domain based largely on the route taken by the Vipermen as they head south spreading
their menace. Having assembled all the intelligence possible, you have finally identified
the likely site of Vortan's lair.</p><br>";
echo "<p>Brushing aside large quantities of sand you find a wooden trapdoor with an iron
chainloop set into it. Traces of shed snakeskin can clearly be seen attached to the rough
wooden edges of the trapdoor and you know that this must be the exit used by the
Vipermen. Hope and trepidation take you as you have the door open. Foul air flows from
inside and the intense desert sun casts across the void revealing a set of stone steps carved
into solid rock beneath the sand. You take what might be one final look at the outside
world before heading cautiously down the steps. You reach the foot of the steps safely
and find yourself at the start of a short corridor with rock walls lit by burning torches.</p>";
