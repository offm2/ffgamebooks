                                            About the Book

This book is yet another follow-up to Steve Jackson's seminal House of Hell. The first was
Gaetano Abbondanza's House of Horror and that was actually a prequel. The second was Robert
Douglas' The Curse of Drumer and that was a sequel. Now comes my own effort that was
actually started before either of them: House of Pain. This one is also a sequel.

Believe it or not I actually began this book over eleven years ago. The reasons it took so long
were several. Firstly, I didn't plan it or map it well enough so all I really had to go on were a few
conflicting notes here and there and some maps devoid of any real information. Secondly, I
found it very difficult to take what is essentially a boring location - a house - and make it
interesting. Thirdly, I also found it difficult to stop thinking in terms of 'forward progression'.
What I mean is that a house doesn't really have a straight northward path through it. It's more of
a maze, especially if it's a very large mansion, which the one in my book is. It's not easy to keep
a maze in your head.

So, after two entire maps were scrapped because they were either too easy or too complex
respectively, I devised a third and stuck to it, bringing things in from the other maps where
necessary. I also went 'back to basics' and read a lot about how to write one of these things again,
not least of which was the Lloyd of Gamebooks blog and all of the advice they offered about
game book design there.

However, there is a final reason why it took so long and one not mentioned above. That reason is
the fact that I just found the whole thing too difficult and very rarely felt in the mood to so much
as add a single paragraph. It's very hard to write anything when you don't feel like it.

As luck would have it I went to work for a while in China. I hated it. The internet was so bad for
me there and without that I simply didn't know what to do with myself. I couldn't call anyone
because I didn't know anyone. So I just sat down one day after ten years of not doing very much
with the project at all. I think I had completed less than a one hundred references and I still didn't
really know why the person was in the house anyway or what they were really searching for.
That's what bad planning gets you. Suffice to say, when you have nothing else to do even a
difficult thing becomes easier.

I found a small game book called Phobia by Zachary Carango and loved the idea of actually
including negative things in the design of each new character. I blatantly stole the idea for my
own book and, all of a sudden, things started to come together a bit more. At this time I
rediscovered a very old and long-abandoned project called The Curse by various. Let's just say
that from reading that I suddenly knew why my person was in the House and what he was
looking for.

Additionally I suddenly discovered Andrew Wright's Beyond the Pit and Jonathon Green's You
Are The Hero. These books also helped me find and fire up the old creativity that I thought I'd
lost. All of the reasons above helped me progress to finally finishing something relatively
quickly, whereas before I honestly thought that I'd barely even started it. This is why I never
announced to anyone on the Internet that I was writing a sequel to Steve Jackson's House of Hell,
because I thought for years that I would never complete it.

It's strange then that this adventure ended up at a large 499 sections as opposed to the more
normal and easier to obtain 400 references. This alone proves that I had at last found the old
creative spark.

This book is difficult, no doubt about that, and you will need to map it to stand a chance, but
there is a way through. I've play tested it several times and can get through without too much
trouble, but then I know the book and the routes very well. It's not as difficult as Hellfire because
there is far less of the convoluted stuff required in that book. There are also no silly tests that
instantly kill you and very few high skill opponents. I'm not sure if it's more difficult than Riders
of the Storm but instinct tells me that it is, hopefully in a good way.


As for playing the book itself I hope I may offer one piece of advice and that is to at least try to
play it without 'cheating'. In my opinion it is so much more satisfying to out-think the writer and
beat them at their own game, thereby gaining a real sense of achievement.

Talking of which, this may be the first game book ever and almost certainly the first Fighting
Fantasy book to offer the reader 'Achievements,' some of which may entertain them enough for
repeat plays.

This book is complete then, edited, play tested and adjusted. That doesn't mean that everything I
wanted to put in it actually went in. To wit: there used to be a selection of items to choose from
at the start such, but these soon morphed into the four Special Items that you always take with
you. Also, there were abilities to choose from such as Swimming, Perception and Ancient
Languages. In the end, I felt there were already enough options for character design and that the
reader had enough to worry about as it was. Lastly, there was going to be a selection of different
endings like there are in The Diamond Key by Ulysses Ai. However, I ran out of references and
realised that the new achievements may give just as much replay value as that sort of thing.

There you have it then. It took a long time to complete but it's finally here: House of Pain. My
third Fighting Fantasy game book. I know I said I'd never write another one after Riders and I
sort of did stick to my guns for ten years, but sooner or later the old FF calling cannot be ignored
and the book is now finished.

Love it or hate it.

                                   Skill, Stamina, Luck and Fear

Roll one die. Add 6 to the number rolled and enter this total in the    SKILL box on the Adventure
Sheet.

Roll two dice. Add 12 to the number rolled and enter this total in the STAMINA box.

Roll one die. Add 6 to the number rolled and enter this total in the LUCK box.

Roll two dice. Add 12 to the number rolled and enter this total in the FEAR  box.

For reasons that will be explained below, all your scores will change constantly during the
adventure. You must keep an accurate record of these scores, and for this reason you are advised
to write small in the boxes or to keep an eraser handy. But never rub out your Initial scores,
except on those very rare occasions when the text specifically tells you so.

Your   SKILL reflects your expertise in combat, your dexterity and agility. Your      STAMINA  score
reflects how healthy and physically fit you are. Your  LUCK  score indicates how naturally fortunate
a person you are. Your   FEAR score indicates both your bravery and your sanity.


                                               Battles

During your adventure you will often encounter hostile creatures which will attack you, and you
yourself may choose to draw your sword against an enemy you chance across. In some situations
you may be given special options, allowing you to deal with the encounter in an unusual manner,
but in most cases you will have to resolve battles as described below.

Enter your opponent's      SKILL and STAMINA   scores in the first empty Encounter box on your
Adventure Sheet. You should also make a note of any special abilities or instructions that are
unique to that particular opponent. Then follow this sequence:

1. Roll two dice for your opponent. Add its      SKILL score to the total rolled, to find its Attack
    Strength.

2. Roll two dice for yourself; add your current   SKILLscore to find your Attack Strength.

3. If your Attack Strength is higher than your opponent's, you have wounded it: proceed to step
4. If your opponent's Attack Strength is higher than yours is, it has wounded you: proceed to step
5. If both Attack Strength totals are the same, the round is a draw: proceed to step 6.

4. You have wounded your opponent, so subtract 2 points from its       STAMINA score. You may use
LUCK  here to do additional damage (see below). Proceed to step 7.

5. Your opponent has wounded you, so subtract 2 points from your       STAMINA  score. You may use
LUCK  to reduce the loss of STAMINA (see below). Proceed to step 7.

6. You and your opponent are now in deadlock! To see who wins the Attack Round you may
toss a coin and, whilst it is in mid-air, call &quot;Heads&quot; or &quot;Tails&quot;. If you call correctly: proceed to
step 4. If you call incorrectly: proceed to step 5. You may, if you don't have a coin to hand,
choose to toss a die instead and call &quot;odds&quot; or &quot;evens,&quot; then follow the same rules above.

7. Begin the next Attack Round, starting again at step 1. This sequence continues until the
STAMINA   score of either you or your opponent reaches zero, which means death. If your opponent
dies, you are free to continue with your adventure. If you die your adventure ends and you must
start all over again by creating a new character.


                               Fighting More Than One Opponent

If you come across more than one creature in a particular encounter, the instructions on that page
will tell you whether you must fight the creatures one at a time or all together.

If you are instructed to fight the creatures singly, the battle proceeds exactly as described above.
However, if you defeat the first creature listed, you must then immediately begin fighting the
second creature on the list. You fight the creatures one at a time, but you must continue fighting
until all your enemies are slain (or until you are). You may not pause between fighting different
creatures for any reason (such as taking some steps to restore lost  STAMINA  points).

If you are instructed to fight all the creatures together, you must fight all of the in one battle. In
step 1 of the combat sequence above, you must calculate Attack Strengths for all the creatures
attacking you. In step 3, if the Attack Strength of any of your opponents is higher than yours, you
must proceed to step 5. If you have the highest Attack Strength of all, proceed to step 4 and you
may choose which of your opponents you have struck. Again, combat proceeds until either you
or all your enemies is slain.


                                            Instant Death

If, during the course of a battle, you roll a double six when calculating your Attack Strength then
(regardless of your enemy's Attack Strength in that round) you have dealt your opponent such a
mighty blow that you have killed them outright! If this happens then you have won that
particular battle and do not have to resolve the rest of the fight. It is worth noting, however, that
this ability may not work on every foe; you will be told of the rare occasions that this is so.


                                              Weapons

You start this adventure unarmed and so must deduct 3 points from your Attack Strength. When
you acquire a weapon you will be told how many points of your Attack Strength you will regain.
You may only use one weapon at a time. For instance, a lowly dagger may only give you one
Attack Strength point back when you use it, meaning you must deduct 2 points from your Attack
Strength when using it in battle. However, should you find a better weapon then you may be
instructed to fight with only 1 point deducted from your Attack Strength. Only the very best
weapons in the game will allow you to regain all of your lost points and fight at full Attack
Strength once again.

Remember that although you may carry more than one weapon with you, you may still only use
one at a time during combat and must choose which one you want to use whenever you have
more than one.


                                              Escaping

On some pages you may be given the option of running away from a battle should things be
going badly for you. However, if you do run away, your opponent automatically gets in one
wound on you (subtract 2 STAMINA points) as you flee. Such is the price of cowardice! Note that
you may use    LUCK on this wound in the normal way (see below). You may only Escape if that
option is specifically given to you on the page.


                                                Luck

At various times during your adventure, either in battles or when you come across other
situations in which you could either be Lucky or Unlucky (details of these are given in the
relevant paragraphs), you may use       LUCK  to make the outcome more favourable to you. But
beware! Using   LUCK is a risky business and, if your are Unlucky, the results could be disastrous.


The procedure for Testing your Luck works as follows: roll two dice. If the number rolled is less
than or equal to your current     LUCK score, you have been Lucky and the outcome will be in your
favour. If the number rolled is higher than your current     LUCK score, you have been Unlucky and
will be penalised.

Each time you Test your Luck, you must subtract 1 point from your current        LUCK score. Thus you
will soon realise that, the more you rely on your   LUCK , the more risky this procedure will become.


                                         Using Luck in Battles

In certain paragraphs you will be told to Test your Luck, and you will then find out the
consequences of being Lucky or Unlucky. However, in battles you always have the option of
using your   LUCK , either to inflict more serious damage on an opponent you have just wounded or
to minimise the effects of a wound you have just received.

If you have just wounded an opponent, you may Test your Luck as described above. If you are
Lucky you have inflicted a severe wound; deduct an extra 2 points from your opponent's         STAMINA
score. If you are Unlucky, however, your blow only scratches your opponent, and you deduct
only 1 point from your opponent's       STAMINA  (instead of scoring the normal 2 points of damage,
you now only score 1).

Whenever you yourself are wounded in combat you may Test your Luck to try and minimise the
wound. If you are Lucky, your opponent's blow only grazes you; deduct only 1 point from your
STAMINA  . If you are Unlucky, your wound is a serious one and you must deduct 1 extra         STAMINA
point (i.e. a total of 3 points from your own   STAMINA ). Remember: you must subtract 1 point from
your  LUCK  score each time you Test your Luck.


                                      More About Your Attributes

                                                  Skill
Your   SKILL  score will not change much during the course of your adventure. Occasionally a
paragraph may give you instructions to increase or decrease your          SKILL score, but it may not
exceed its Initial value unless you are specifically instructed to the contrary.

At various times during your adventure, you will be told to Test your Skill. The procedure for
this is exactly the same as that for Testing your Luck: roll two dice. If the number rolled is less
than or equal to your current      SKILLscore, you have been Skilful and the result will go in your
favour. If the number rolled is higher than your current    SKILL score, you have been Unskilful and
will have to suffer the consequences. However, unlike Testing your Luck, do not subtract 1 point
from your    SKILL each time you Test your Skill. Your   SKILL score can never exceed its initial value
unless specifically instructed on a page.

                                                Stamina
Your   STAMINA  score will change a lot during your adventure but it may not exceed its Initial value
unless you are specifically instructed to the contrary. It will drop as a result of wounds received
through combat, or by falling foul of traps and pitfalls; and it will also drop after you perform
any particularly arduous task. If your     STAMINA score ever falls to zero or below, you have been
killed and should stop reading the book immediately. Brave adventurers who wish to pursue their
quest must roll up a new character and start all over again.

There will be occasions when you will be told to Test your Stamina. The procedure for this is a
little different from the procedures required when Testing your Luck or Testing your Skill; and is
as follows: roll four dice. If the number rolled is less than or equal to your current STAMINA   score,
you have been Strong and the result will go in your favour. If the number rolled is higher than
your current    STAMINA  score, you have been Weak and will have to suffer the consequences.
However, unlike Testing your Luck, do not subtract 1 point from your       STAMINA each time you Test
your Stamina.


You do not start this adventure with any provisions and must look for ways to regain            STAMINA
during your quest.

                                                 Luck
Additions to your   LUCK score may be awarded in the adventure when you have been particularly
lucky or created your own luck by some other action. Details are given, where appropriate, in the
paragraphs of the book. Remember that, as with        SKILL and STAMINA   , your LUCK score may never
exceed its initial value unless specifically instructed on a page.

                                                 Fear
During this adventure you will face many disturbing and horrific situations and there is a very
real chance that if you encounter too many of these events your mind will snap and you will be
frightened to death!

Your  FEAR score is unusual in that it starts at zero. However, there will be many situations where
you are instructed to add points to this score and only a precious few where you will be
instructed to deduct any. Should it eventually reach your initial score you will die of fright.

There will be occasions during the adventure where you will be instructed to Test Your Fear.
The procedure for this is as follows: roll four dice. If the number rolled is equal to or higher than
your current FEAR score, you have been Fearless and the result will go in your favour. If the
number rolled is lower than your current      FEAR  score, you have been Fearful and will have to
suffer the consequences. However, unlike Testing your Luck, do not subtract 1 point from your
FEAR each time you Test your Fear.

You will notice that unlike Testing your Skill, Stamina and Luck, you are actually trying to roll
equal to or above your current   FEAR score, not below. This means that the higher your      FEAR score
becomes the more difficult it will be to be successful when you Test your Fear. This is another
reason to try and keep your  FEAR score low.


                                A Note about Testing Your Attributes

There will be times during your adventure when you will come across an unusually dangerous
situation and your  SKILL STAMINA LUCK
                         ,        ,      or  FEAR will be tested to the full; for example you may be
instructed to Test your Skill, `adding 2 to the number rolled'. This simply means that when you
roll the dice you must add 2 to the total; so if you had rolled a 1 and a 3, for example, your
modified total would be 6 (1 + 3 + 2 = 6). You then compare this outcome with your current
SKILL score to discover whether or not you have succeeded in the test.


                                         Secret References

When attempting the adventure you must remember that this book can be devious. If ever you
come to a point in the quest that seems impossible to pass beyond, you may require a Secret
Reference to help you. Secret References are paragraph numbers that can only be reached if you
have acquired special knowledge of their existence, and how do you go about finding that
knowledge? Play the book and look for it!


                                            Special Items

You always start each adventure with all four of these items. They are unusual in that they or
their uses will never be directly referred to in the text. Instead, it is up to you to look for clues as
to when to use each of them during the adventure.

    1. Dragon tattoo on your back (to attempt to use it you must double the paragraph number
        you're on and then turn to the new number. The new number must double exactly,
        without rounding up or down. If the new paragraph is the correct one it will mention the


       item you're trying to use by name, and you may carry on as usual. If the new paragraph is
       incorrect, it will make no sense and you must return to the previous paragraph.

       Each time you use this at the wrong location you must deduct 1     LUCK point.

                                  Advice concerning Special Items

Whilst the use of these items is not absolutely essential to the success of the overall adventure, it
is advised that you should still attempt to use as many of them as possible, because without the
correct usage of at least two of them the challenge may prove too great.


                                             Phobias

Your years in prison and then the institution, together with the nightmares that have plagued you,
have made you neurotic, fearful and prone to panic attacks. To show this you have developed
several phobias. To indicate this you must choose three from the following list:

Aquaphobia             (fear of water)
Cartilogenophobia      (fear of bones)


Catoptrophobia        (fear of mirrors)
Claustrophobia        (fear of confined spaces)
Dysmorphophobia       (fear of deformity)
Insectophobia         (fear of insects)
Musophobia            (fear of rats)
Mysophobia            (fear of germs)
Phasmophobia          (fear of ghosts)
Pyrophobia            (fear of fire)
Toxiphobia            (fear of poison)

                                          Primal Fear

Now you must select one more Phobia from the above list, but it may not be one you've already
chosen. Mark this third Phobia down in the designated space on your adventure sheet as your
Primal Fear - the thing you dread more than any other.

                          A note about Phobias and your Primal Fear

Your phobias may prove highly detrimental to the task ahead or only bothersome depending
upon the situation. Several combinations at certain times may even prove deadly, although this
would be a rare occurrence. Your Primal Fear, on the other hand, is always classed as highly
dangerous and can be extremely debilitating. For these reasons you should consider each
potentially phobia-aggravating situation very carefully.

                                                Hints

There is one true way through this adventure and it will take you several attempts to find it (and
then some!).

Make notes and draw a map as you explore � this map will be invaluable in future adventures
and enable you to progress rapidly through to unexplored sections. It may help to draw three
separate maps: one for the grounds and ground floor, one for the second floor and one for the
cellar.

Not all areas contain treasure or other useful items; many merely contain traps and monsters that
you will no doubt fall foul of. There are many `wild-goose chase' passages and while you may
indeed progress through to your ultimate destination, it is by no means certain that you will find
what you are searching for.

It will be realised that entries make no sense if read in numerical order. It is essential that you
read only the entries you are instructed to read. Reading other entries will only cause confusion
and may lessen the excitement during play.

The one true way involves a minimum of risk and any player, no matter how weak on initial dice
rolls, should be able to get through fairly easily.

Good luck on your adventure but, remember, real heroes don't cheat!

                                             Background

In the day I sit alone surrounded by shadows and silence, and at night I dream of demons and
blood.

Sometimes, when the wind blows forcefully I could swear I hear voices taunting and laughing at
me. At other times, whether night or day but most commonly at night, I fancy I spy things
moving in the dark corners of my cell. Now and again, when the night is moonless and the rain
falls hard, I'm sure there are shadowy creatures running amok through the grounds outside, far
below my window. All this is irrelevant though, because I am a madman and nothing I say is of
any consequence.

I've had constant nightmares since I left the House, and they've been getting worse. It's almost
as if something is coming for me. I have spoke of these dreams many times to the doctors that
visit me, but they just nod, smile and take notes.

The dreams, ah yes, they are always dark and always involve fire... fire and blood. Yes, an
inferno rages all around me and I sit in a pool of blood. I sit there every night waiting for the
shadow-creatures to come for me. I never really get to actually see the creatures, just fleeting
images of them, warped and distorted, but that doesn't stop me from greatly fearing them.

Am I mad? That's what the doctors keep telling me, they say I'm insane and a danger to both the
public and myself; after all, was it not I who burnt down and killed all those inside the House?
Of course it was me; but those weren't people I killed, they were demons and abominations.

They all deserved to die.

Did it all really happen? Was I really there? Did I really fight and kill them all? Well, I'm pretty
sure I did, but all the doctors tell me I shouldn't think like that, because I'm just a poor crazed
arsonist. Nobody cares what I say though. In fact, I get the feeling that people would rather I
didn't say anything at all. I also get the distinct feeling that I'm not very popular around here.
That's putting it too politely. I am hated. Everyone around here hates me and everyone laughs at
me: a pathetic, degraded maniac. Who cares if a filthy murderer lives or dies? In fact the only
reason I'm still alive is because I'm afraid of what awaits me on the Other Side.

The House... ah yes, the memories of the House are still with me and still strong. I remember
well the things I encountered there: the torture, the suffering, the sadism, the blood and the pain.
I stopped it though, I stopped it all, for good. However, I can never seem to say that last bit and
truly believe it.

How long have I been here? How long have I been locked up in this empty cell for? I look
around at its four bare walls and get the horrible feeling that they are looking back at me. What's
more, when it's quiet, I could swear I hear things scrabbling in the walls; desperate to break out
and get at me... How long I've been here you ask? In truth I simply don't know because one day
just melts into the next, till in the end each week, month and year are indistinguishable from the
last.

How did I get here? I'm not too sure if you want me to speak honestly. I remember the police
station, the press, the flashing lights, the baying crowds. I remember some of the trial: the
jeering, the shouting and the spitting. I don't remember much about prison though because I
wasn't there very long. Prison wasn't so bad though, better than this place; at least there were
other people I could talk to there, apart from doctors that is. At first I was glad to be moved from
the prison to a secure home, because I thought things would be easier.

It almost makes me laugh when I realise how pathetically wrong I was.

Now turn over...

                                                   1
I escaped.

I had to. I didn't have a choice. I had to go back to the House to make sure it was over, to make
sure it was all real.

All I had with me were a few sheets of paper, a pencil and a small rucksack, but I had to try.

The escape was easy really. I was always a model inmate and so people tended to trust me a lot
more than the others. One night then, I pick-pocketed a key off a dozing guard and hid it until
everyone else was asleep. Then I stole a few clothes from the laundry room and a bit of money
from the office and snuck out into darkness.

I hadn't been entirely idle all of these years; I'd done my research. I knew where the House was
and how to get there. It wasn't all that difficult, a few trains, a few hours, a taxi and a bit of
walking. At least that's the way I remember it.

Here I am then.

Sneaking through the undergrowth and through the moonlight, back to where I knew the ruin of
the House was. A few more minutes and I'd be well within range of it. As I part the final few
branches and prepare myself for the truth or otherwise about it I am met with such a shock that I
almost cry out: the House is still standing and completely unharmed!

No. That's not right. It's not the same House at all.

It's been rebuilt.

It's larger than ever and now sits in considerable grounds that are entirely surrounded by
impossibly high railings.

You are simply dumbfounded and almost at a loss for words. Your thoughts become hazy, you
start to sway. Maybe it is the same House after all? Perhaps you didn't destroy it because it didn't
happen? Yes. That's it. You're an insane murderer who deserves their punishment. Of course!
You should turn around and go back to your cell. Or you should just kill yourself right now by
biting your wrists.

Blink.

No. You can hear other people and notice a line of them walking through colossal gates and into
the grounds beyond, and yet where are their cars? You're in the middle of nowhere and they have
no idea of the danger they're in, if not from the House then from you. You must warn them but
you're not sure if you should, because you're not sure how much of this is real.

After a few minutes you decide to try and help them and walk after the small line of people,
through the gates and into the grounds.

The endless drive snakes through the crowd of trees that forever threaten its borders with their
outstretched limbs. You peer at them as they huddle together in the darkness like beggars, which
is appropriate, because the further you progress down this path the more you begin to become
aware of an unpleasant stench lingering in the air.

The drive then breaks free of the trees and passes through a large garden. This new section is
flanked by twin rows of shadowy and silent individuals. It is only when you approach still closer
that these individuals' identities and the source of the unpleasant stench both become known.
This is because the pitiful twisted masses of flesh that shamble about before you are zombies.
You quickly place your hand over your mouth in a somewhat vain attempt to stop yourself
gagging. Easier said than done when faced with a hoard of eyeless undead, each sporting their
own imitations of death: protruding bones, caved in stomach, torn neck or a charred and burnt
face. Whether they sport one, several or even all of these misfortunes is irrelevant. What is not


quite so irrelevant is that the party of people you're following is walking idly through them,
chatting happily amongst themselves and apparently completely oblivious to the horrible danger
than lurks a mere few feet from them.

You are just beginning to idly wonder if some sort of illusion is at work here or whether perhaps
the guests have been hypnotised, when a sudden movement amongst the guests grabs your
attention. A young man has just stopped and is looking all around him, turning quickly this way
and that as he does so, a look of horror dawning on his face as though a giant veil had just been
lifted from about him causing him to see things as they really are. At first the zombies take no
notice and merely stand quite still or continue to shamble aimlessly about. This doesn't last long
though as one of them seems to see him and make a vague grab for him, emitting as it does so
what must be some sort of attempt at speech, but the only sounds that leave its rotten lips are
horrible and inhuman. Its brain is clearly no longer capable of any remotely complex actions
such as those that might lead it to communication. On the other hand it could just be because its
tongue has been bitten off or its lungs have collapsed and flooded its throat with blood. Either of
these things is entirely possible but, one thing's for sure in any of these possible cases, and that's
that these poor, wretched creatures have long since lost all trace of humanity. They are devoid of
all emotion and of all reason and can only muster up the vaguest semblance of thought, leaving
them to remain only a sickening mockery of the human beings they must have once been. They
are now creatures of the most basic of instincts, one of which is the need to feed.

The man backs away from the first zombie but straight into the arms of three more. They sink
their rotten fingernails into his arms, causing him to cry out in agony. The other guests take no
notice and continue to talk amongst themselves as they walk straight past the gory scene. Now
the first zombie has reached the man and leans its face towards his, obscuring the unfortunate
individual from your view as it does so. At first you think that the creature is once more
attempting to speak to him but when it removes its head and unblocks your view the man lets out
a terrific scream because his bottom lip has been bitten off. At that moment all three of the
zombies begin to tear at the man with their teeth and nails, ignoring his incredible screams as
they do so.

You shake in horror at the scene unfolding in front of you and slowly back away towards the
gate, making sure that none of the other zombies notice you doing so. However, you cannot seem
to escape the man's screams and find yourself praying that he just dies soon.

You back all the way to the now closed and locked gate; the roars of pain following you every
step of the way. You sense the gate behind you and turn around, only to come face to face with
three raggedly dressed, hooded figures that stand on the other side of it. You stare at them as
each one raises its diseased arm up to its black hood and then slowly pulls it back to reveal a
decomposing face. Their skin is blackened and looks dead, their empty eye sockets and rotten
mouths all pour with sickly yellow mucus. Each one of the creatures then raises its other decayed
arm and points at you with a single bony finger. Then their mucus-filled mouths widen into a
twisted grin as they each speak a single word: &quot;Death.&quot;

Add 1  FEAR  point.

You take a step back, knowing that there is now no escape this way, and cover your mouth to
stop from crying out. These creatures are known as The Messengers of Death. They are assassins
who like to play a deadly game with their quarry. Each of them will wait until you leave and then
go ahead of you and leave one of a series of letters at some place in the surrounding areas. These
letters will comprise of those that make up the word `Death.' It will be obvious when you find
one because it will be written in blood. You should make a note of whenever you discover one of
these `Death Letters' because if you should ever uncover enough of them to spell out the word
`Death,' you are surely dead. This would be bad enough if there were just one set of letters, but
three? Worse still, the letters themselves are merely enchanted spots of blood and will, when you
come across them, automatically change to become the next letter in the sequence, meaning you
can only ever afford to find four of them, because should you uncover five, the Messengers will
instantly appear and seize your life-force.


Doing your best to ignore the horrible creatures, you turn with sudden speed and make a dart to
the left and get ready to jump at the impossibly tall railings that surround the whole estate; before
you do though a bloody figure rushes past you, screaming as he does so. The figure leaps at the
railings and is instantly turned into an inferno as an immense electric shock is passed through
him, immediately setting his clothes on fire and quickly reducing him to a quivering mass of
melted and blackened flesh. A few seconds more of this and the poor soul falls to the ground, his
body still twitching occasionally. You fight back the tears that threaten to engulf you, not only
for the appalling scene you have just witnessed but also for yourself. For you now know full well
that there can be no escape from this place and that your only option is to try and fight back.

You pull out a sheet of paper from your back pocket and take a pencil from within your jacket
pocket and decide to map out the grounds of the House as you go along.

Forcing yourself to look away, you take a deep breath and consider your options. Just to your
north and back up the trail a little way, is a tiny darkened house overlooking the trail that you
assume must belong to the groundkeeper? If you wish to investigate it, turn to 289. To your east
is what looks like the entrance to an enclosed 'secret garden' area, complete with fountain, pond
and greenhouse. If you wish to visit it, turn to 143. To your north, the path continues to wind
through the trees, but the people and the silent creatures seem to have moved on. If you wish to
go this way, turn to 233. Turning your head to the north-east you notice a thin path making its
way to a glistening lake. If you want to go this way, turn to 39. To your north-west and off the
main path you can make out the white dome of what you assume to be the family's mausoleum.
If you feel like a closer look, turn to 355. To your west is a trail that leads to what seems to be a
statue-filled garden. Turn to 195, go there if you wish.

and are rather shocked when the door opens to allow you access!

Add 1   LUCK  point.

As you step across the threshold your happiness fades to dread as you soon acknowledge that
you are now in some sort of twisted trophy room. The things on display here are hacked off
faces, hearts, skinned bodies and jars full of eyes. There are also a few displays of living people,
each nailed to the wall, with their eyes and mouths stitched shut.

In the centre of all this grisly torment and resting on a pedestal decorated with winding snakes, is
a small red ribbon. This must be one of the blessed things you are looking for to help power the
Spear of Destiny! You grab the ribbon and pocket it quickly.

either the raging fire or what's left of the zombies and so you do not and will not try south. To
your left your current passage continues a spell before turning north and south at a wall. You
note with interest that that wall is far more covered in runes than the others. If you wish to walk
north, turn to 299. If you'd rather head left and try the next northern exit, turn to 167.

The Eternal Nightmare screams so loudly that you're temporarily deafened, then she fades away
into nothing.

Add 1   LUCK point and deduct 1  FEAR point.

Relieved, you close your eyes a moment and wake up sat on the floor slumped against the wall.
Up you get, glad to be free of the repulsive clinging fur about you, and walk on.

Subsequently, you walk on past where the horrible spirit was and round a corner leading further
forwards into the House.

Like a bolt out of the blue, a horrible realisation dawns upon you as you realise that the place
you're walking into is just the same as the last and there sat upon the floor slumped against the
wall is your sleeping body. You only dreamt that you awoke but you are still trapped within the
nightmare.

Around you the walls start to shimmer then fade away, the floor falls to oblivion and the ceiling
departs into nothingness. Suddenly a horrible scream is heard from somewhere within the
blackness.

At that very moment a series of no less than eleven doors fade into view around you and float
there in the emptiness, each one looking just like a normal door but at the same time also a
horrible deadly portal. Each of these exits are identical apart from the fact that they all have a
different cryptic word scratched upon them: 'Elephant,' 'Lift,' 'Sad,' 'Dog,' 'London,' 'Black,'
'Vampire,' 'Worker,' 'Manifest,' 'Werewolf,' and 'Microscopic.'

Unknown to you each of these doors corresponds with the phobias you may have. To leave this
realm you will have to open one of these portals trying your best to avoid anything that sounds
like it could be a subtle hint for something you are afraid of. If you choose a door that leads to an
ordinary phobia you will probably be reasonably okay. If you choose something which triggers
your Primal Fear you might never leave this place.

Another scream pierces the air and the shuffling of bare feet can be head somewhere within the
blackness. You must think quickly yet carefully and then choose a door.

If you try the door marked 'Elephant' turn to 449.
If you try the door marked 'Lift' turn to 382.
If you try the door marked 'Sad' turn to 286.
If you try the door marked 'Dog' turn to 25.

The sickening smell of a giant aviary greets you. Above you there is no roof so that the dozens of
birds here present can come and go as they please leaving behind what must surely be thousands
of droppings. The stench is overpowering. Not to mention the loud chatter of all of the birds
whose rest you have just disturbed. Even now they flit and flutter about you in a cloud of
feathers.

A voice startles you.

There in the middle of the room in a cage is a raggedly dressed man, covered from head to foot
in droppings.

&quot;I should think myself lucky,&quot; he says with a smile baring yellowed teeth, &quot;this has got to be the
least of all the punishments that He could have given me. I guess I must have been one of his
favourites!&quot;

You assume him to be talking of Yarles.

&quot;So what are you here for? To taunt me, torture me or perhaps you'd like to just join me?&quot; he
says with a mocking laugh.

You tell him that you mean him no harm.

The ragged man looks surprised but recovers quickly, &quot;Away from the flock, eh?&quot; he asks with a
knowing look. &quot;Look what happens if you so much as take one step away from the Coven.&quot;

You assure him that you are here on Yarles' orders and that you may even let him out if he can
help you.

The raggedly man throws his head back and laughs, &quot;He has never let anyone out of anything!
Look closely at the lock on this cage.&quot;

You do as he asks but cannot find any lock and ask him where it is.

&quot;There isn't one. I will stay here until I die, but that's still a hundred times better than those
suffering the Undeath: always dying but never dead.&quot;

Changing tact you tell him that what you meant by 'let him out' was that you'd let him out of a
slow death from thirst if he merely gives you something of use in return.

The man smiles at you and counters, &quot;Trying to raise above our station in the Brotherhood are
we? Trying to profit from a man's death? I like you already! You'll go far in the Coven with your
attitude!&quot;

Pretending to find him funny you ask him how he got here.

&quot;I was to feed the Great Worm but I must admit that on one occasion I was late with his supper
and here I am!&quot;

Condemned to a slow death for that? you think to yourself.

The man laughs at your puzzled expression, &quot;My friend your acting skills are priceless! I see the
makings of a Dark Priest in you!&quot;

Trying to fool him some more you tell him that you yourself must now feed the Great Worm and
that you shall do your best to poison it.

On hearing this the raggedy man slaps his thigh and says through tears of laughter, &quot;I don't think
for one moment that you even know what he is, do you?&quot; He then sits in his cage and sneers at
you.


Trying to press him for further discussion has no effect on him and he remains silent and defiant.
Electing to leave and cursing him for his uselessness, you trudge back to the junction and take
the very long exit previously to your left, turn to 152.

&quot;That is the correct answer,&quot; intones the skeleton.

A sense of relief washes over you.

&quot;My second question is how many keys are there to be found?&quot;

Before you can think the skeleton speaks again.

&quot;Only this time I want you to double the number that you think of before telling me the answer.&quot;

You think, taking care to double the number this time, and again you say the number out loud.

If, you are wrong, the skeleton will warp you back to the vampire's room and wipe your memory

She is an inch away from your throat when she sees the cross about your neck. The effect is
instantaneous: she rips herself from you with a scream and staggers back with a look of
animalistic fear upon her face.

Add 1   LUCK point.

Now you need to go for your weapon but you'll need to buy some time because the moment you
lose even a second's concentration, she'll be upon you, cross or no cross. That's because this is a
very old vampire that's been in the service of Hell for centuries. So her reaction to the cross was
more one of reflex than actual intimidation. In short, it will hold her but not for long. She will
recover and will simply try and gut you with her nails from arm's length.

The scene would perhaps be too much for an ordinary person but you are used to the House and
its tricks and simply refuse to believe in all this. At this thought the nightmare breaks for real and
you are back where you were: sitting slumped on the floor amongst the hairy carpet next to the
wall.

Add 1   LUCK point.

Leaping to your feet you run through the fog further to the right and locate a turning to the north.
Looking down this turning you are relieved to observe a brand new area of the House. This new
area is a dark narrow passageway full of more runes than usual. It goes on a few yards and then
breaks out into a horizontal passage. Halfway along to its left is a door named 'Puella'. It is burnt
and warped and covered in so many runes that it's difficult to tell if there was any decoration on


it prior to them. However, you get the sinking feeling that the runes are somehow older than the
door ever was.

You are just on the edge of trying the handle when you notice that a huge iron chain has been

You slip the key into the giant lock and give it a twist. This causes the great chains to instantly
fall to the ground with a heavy metallic thump. Now you grasp one of the cellar doors and make
ready to lift it. This is no mean feat though because it is even heavier than it looks and is almost
at the limit of what somebody your size could even consider lifting. Test your Stamina. If you are
Strong, the doors open, turn to 53. If you are Weak, deduct 1 point from your       STAMINA  for the

You tell him that this is true and that if he doesn't help you soon he shall be the first thing you

The man's expression suddenly changes as subtle signs of fear make themselves apparent, &quot;Okay,

You gaze at the boat and then gaze at the water. A nameless dread starts to gnaw at you and you
find it difficult to concentrate let alone just swallow the fear all together. So there you stand for
no short time, willing yourself to enter the boat, refusing to give into the fear that threatens to eat
you from the inside. Sweat forms on your forehead, you start to shake, your stomach turns and
your breathing quickens. You hear your heart pound in your ears and feel your senses scream at
you to stay away from the giant black grave in front of you. You look into the water and find
yourself transfixed as it looks back into you, and all the nameless filth that inhabit that
bottomless pit are even now waiting for you with outstretched arms, just waiting for you to even
take one step into the boat. Then they will overturn it, grab you, take you down into the

The door is heavy and weighted so that every time you manage to force it open a little it insists
on starting to close again, meaning you have to put quite some effort into finally getting through
the damn thing. Once through, the door slowly closes behind you.

You take a single step forward and are instantly assailed by an awful smell that makes you gag
and screw up your eyes in disgust. You cough a few times and place your arm across your
mouth.

What on earth could cause such a stench?

You unscrew your eyes and notice that you are in a short corridor with a thick iron door at one
end and a tiny barred window to your left that lets in just enough gloomy light to barely
illuminate your surroundings. It takes a few moments for your eyes to adjust to the gloom and
when they do, they widen in shock. The corridor you are standing in is absolutely covered in a
disgusting green slime. It dribbles down the walls, forms in pools on the floor and even clings to
the ceiling. You quickly hazard a guess that this unwelcome substance is the source of the foul
odour. You shake your head in wonder and not a little disgust and then begin to pick your way
through the puddles and approach the iron door at the corridor's end.

The door is incredibly thick and sports no handle or keyhole. However, it is covered in
decorations of sacrifice and feint inscriptions written in a language unknown to you. You gaze in
wonder at this new obstacle and notice that even the wall surrounding it is riddled with equally
feint carvings that are now worn almost completely away, meaning that it is impossible to decide
what they once were. You still stare at them though, for they look hideously ancient. This
thought makes you shudder, then a noise behind you catches your attention and you turn around.

Something is standing in the shadows at the opposite end of the corridor.

It is difficult to make it out in the gloom but it is resembles a naked, sexless humanoid with the
usual two arms, two legs and head. That is where the similarity ends though because, as it starts
to stagger towards you, you notice that its head sports a pair of horns and, to your horror, it has
no face. What is more is that the creature, whatever it is, is covered in the same filthy green slime
that the rest of this place is.

You are just about to arm yourself when a pool of slime at your feet bubbles violently and then
sprays into your face with terrific force as a familiar horned head bursts through it, only this head
sports a pair of dark pits where its eyes should be. For a few seconds you are too shocked to
move and in those precious few moments the entire passage shakes. Then, all around you, slimy
misshapen heads, and lumpy arms start to burst through the ooze, not only in the floor but also


the walls and the ceiling. The creature at your feet suddenly sends an impossibly long arm
shooting through the ooze and wraps its slimy fingers around your throat.

You have had enough.

You ignore the chaos irrupting around you, draw your weapon and hack at the filthy fingers that
have encircled your throat, only to cut its entire hand off. This has no effect on the creature
though and it just tries to lash out with the stump of its arm, sending a wash of its foul black
blood into your face. Then, just out of the corner of your eye you notice a flicker of movement in
front of you as the original creature throws itself at you.

If you suffer from Dysmorphophobia you must add 1         FEAR point. You must also deduct 1 from
your Attack Strength for this encounter. However, if it is your Primal Fear, you must add 3        FEAR

After one step just manage to take in a large door across the room in front of you before
flinching as a cocktail of sickening odours assails you. You cover your mouth and quickly take
in the scene, noting that you are now standing in an appallingly filthy kitchen. It comprises of a
vast impossibly grimy cooker, a large sink heaving with flies, several disgusting work surfaces,
including a large stained and rotten table at the centre of the room and a multitude of rusty
utensils, all hanging from the ceiling. Hanging amongst the cutlery are things that look more like
torture implements: spiked hammers, knives with jagged edges and even a full-sized chainsaw,
which is sadly broken beyond all repair.


What on earth have they been cooking here?

As if in answer to this thought you suddenly notice that a lot of the utensils have a slight red stain
to them, as does the table and the work surfaces. You walk over to the sink and notice that the
plughole is blocked by what looks like guts. You shake your head, wondering what poor animal
met its end in such a place as this, no doubt to be sacrificed by the horrors within. You turn away
from it and bump into the table and notice for the first time that there is a chain hanging from
each of its four corners. This discovery causes the hairs on the nape of your neck to stand up,
almost as if some subconscious signal were silently trying to warn you of some great danger.
You back away from the table and almost slip over in front of the oven because you have just
stepped into a pool of some blackened substance that has made the floor slick at this point. You
don't know what the substance is and you don't want to know.

You turn away and examine the rusty great oven. Surely this horrible, dilapidated thing cannot
possibly be used for cooking anymore, least of all in this diseased-ridden place? You look into
the glass section of the oven's front panel but can't see through it at all because it is so encrusted

At a loss at what to do, hemmed in by grisly death on both sides, you decide to take your chances
by heading back into the House, hoping against hope for a way of dealing with the Death Spider.
You are physically staggered then to see, limping through the gloom behind you, cut to pieces,
internal organs trailing behind it: the Horned Demon. Astounded beyond words and simply
unable to comprehend that this creature, riddles with deep gashes, head caved in, no face to
speak of anymore and missing an arm and a foot, is still alive and hobbling towards you. One
step back is all it takes; your foot hits the web, sending a barely noticeable ripple up a single
strand. The Death Spider is awake in an instant and upon you in a blur. It drags you back to its
web where you are soon stuck fast by its sticky strands. Then the great thing seems to observe
you for a moment, seemingly considering its options. After this it carefully cuts you free from its
web and sends you tumbling into the abyss below. What's left of the Horned Demon stands at the


edge and turns what's left of its head towards you as you start to fall. You plummet for what

your head and so the only warning you get of the creature coming from the blind spot to your left
is a slight crunch of gravel. Shocked, you immediately turn to face it, only to have an old-
fashioned oil lamp thrust in your face. Momentarily blinded and rubbing your eyes, you at last
reopen them, find they've adjusted, and stare straight into the bone-white face and deep-sunk
eyes of a creature whose skin is stretched so tightly over its hooded head that it breaks and bleeds

As you head right you quickly become aware of laughter coming from further down this hallway.
After a few more steps, it becomes apparent that the sounds of mirth are coming from a large set
of ornately carved dark wooden doors to your left. They bare the motif 'Esu'. Curious, you place
an ear next to them and make out what seems to be the sound of dozens of people in there -
perhaps they are the people you saw earlier on? Behind the laugher though is another barely
audible sound - crying? It's difficult to say because it sounds muffled. If you want to enter the

The creature lets out a bone-shaking screech that goes straight through you, setting your teeth on
edge and hurting your eyes: it's as if someone momentarily opened the gates of hell and filled
your ears with the screams of the damned. The creature in front of you smiles, revealing broken
teeth. It then advances upon you, clearly intending to rend you limb from limb with its claws.

You do not have a weapon for this fight so must fight bare-handed: deduct 3 from your Attack

On to the right.

Within seconds you spy that the hallway starts to widen so that yet again you get the distinct
impression that it's surely now much too big to fit in the House. Still, you don't have much
choice but to continue, especially because the smell of burning has become stronger and the
distant crackle of flames has now reached your ears.

Moments later, lost in your thoughts, mind turned to the inferno creeping through the darkness
behind you, you are utterly astounded to find a colossal seemingly bottomless cavern ahead of
you, filling the now giant-sized hallway from almost side to side. Across this yawning cavern is
stretched a gigantic web and on that web sits a spider as large as a car. If this were not enough to
shock you to the core, the spider has a human face.

This is a Death Spider, a huge demonic arachnid.

If you suffer from Insectophobia you must add 1       FEARpoint. If it's your Primal Fear, you cannot
face it and must look for another route onwards, turn to 23.

Luckily for you it seems to be sleeping.

Gazing down into the cavern you are greeted with blackness and the slightest hint of some
glistening thing moving far below. There is no way back and apparently no way forward. If you

North. You pass by an angel statue here. It has its hands over its eyes and has its back towards
you as if it can't bare the horror of the House. Such a strange place to find such a strange thing,
you muse. After that your feet take you to the next horizontal passageway of this floor. Here you
are presented with a trio of northern exits. The left leads off into darkness, the middle into light
and the right, as far as you can tell, into fog.

However, there is also has a door just to your right and behind you along the south wall. This
door bares the legend 'Ignis' and is burned and warped so much so that it just looks like a
nightmarish black portal, yet it is obviously incredibly thick and, to your untrained eye, almost
completely sound-proof.

If you wish to open the burned door behind you, turn to 101.

With a little effort you are able to shift the slab from the top of the nearest of the smaller tombs.
The moment you do so you are quite literally staggered by the primordial soup of flesh and bone
that it contains, almost forcing you to lose control of your stomach when some of the gooey mass
laps over the side and flops onto your shoes. This is nothing compared to what happens next, as
the black and green mess in front of you starts to move of its own accord. First of all, a pair of
stinking bony arms rises slowly from the slime, dipping flesh as they do so. Next a half-formed
skull forces itself through the goo and turns to look at you on a rudimentary `neck' of barely
formed spine. Yet there is nothing within the eye sockets and, indeed, nothing within the skull
itself apart from more of the black and green ooze. Whatever this thing is it is alive and
obviously hostile because even now the whole mass is dripping and flopping to the floor,
relentlessly seeking you and you cannot escape it in here.

Unknown to you this thing is a Proto Zombie. It drains the life of living creatures just by being
near them and, what's more, it grows stronger in their presence to boot. To indicate this you


must, whenever it hits you and instead of deducting the usual 2 points of      STAMINA  , deduct single
point and then add this point to its STAMINA .

For each of the following afflictions: Mysophobia, Cartilogenophobia and Dysmorphophobia
you must add a   FEAR  point. If one of them is your Primal Fear, you must add 3    FEAR points for that
one. You must also deduct a point from your Attack Strength for each of them this encounter, or
3 points if one of them is your Primal Fear. However, if you suffer from all three, or, if you
suffer from any two but one of them is your Primal Fear, you must turn at once to 84. If you
suffer from any two but neither is your Primal Fear you may still force yourself to fight but you
must spend a   LUCK  point to do so.

You do not have a weapon for this fight so must fight bare-handed: deduct a further 3 points
from your Attack Strength for this encounter.

The Banshee increases the ferocity of her attack and then there is a shocking moment of pain as
she slices deep into your arm, causing you to roar in pain.

Deduct 1   SKILL point.

This pain causes you to convulse so much that you inadvertently succeed in throwing the
creature off of you.

However, if you suffer from Mysophobia you must add a       FEAR  point and, if it is your Primal Fear,
you must instead add 3   FEAR  points.

The hag is surprised but only for a second, but that second is all she needs to hurl herself at you,
but you have the advantage and dive to one side, just as the bony hag throws herself at you,
claws just missing your face. You get up from the floor and are suddenly momentarily paralysed
as the Banshee once more lets out a sickeningly loud scream that threatens to cut you in two or
drive you insane. Shielding your ears against the uproar you are just in time to notice the
creature's muscles bunch as she squats in the dirt mere meters away from you, evidently getting
ready for another leap at your throat. In less than a second you are running for the boat and for
salvation, with the creature diving at your exposed back. Test your Luck. If you are Lucky, turn

The trail cuts and curves through the trees, twisting unnervingly, sometimes double-backing on
its self, sometimes ruler-straight, either way it has not been designed with any obvious intention
in mind, as though its originator were thinking in almost alien terms that no sane mind could
comprehend.

The trees press in on all sides, blocking out the sky, reaching out at you, tearing your clothes and
scratching your face. A light wind picks up as you fight your way through them, billowing a few
leaves in front of you, making odd noises behind you. All around you the shadows writhe and
squirm, as though there were a giant creature walking here with you.

You find yourself becoming annoyed with the crazy path and its ridiculous design, so much so
that you momentarily consider just walking in a straight line, straight through the trees. As this
though passes through your mind and you look into the shadows around you, a creeping
sensation crawls over your scalp. The black trees that surround you have become quiet: they are
listening.


You walk on quickly and soon notice the glistening lake's outline through the trees ahead of you.
You walk in silence to its edge. The lake is quite large, bordered by trees on all sides, some of
which are bent double, their heads almost touching the lake almost as if they were talking to it.
At the centre of the body of water is a small island complete with a few old trees and a collection
of ragged bushes. Then you notice something else, right at its centre: a gravestone.

The water of the lake looks calm, as though it had not been disturbed in years, if ever and yet
someone must have ventured across it at least once to bury the poor unfortunate on the little
island, not two hundred yards in front of you in the exact middle of the lake. You wonder if there
is anything of note on that small island, and yet the waters do not look inviting at all, regardless
of how calm they seem. You get the feeling that they are bottomless. You have a choice to make.
Will you search the area surrounding the lake for a boat of some sort? If so turn to 236. Or will
you enter the water and attempt to swim to the island instead? Turn to 15.

As you gaze at the markings something clicks in your mind and you find yourself starting to
make sense of them, mad as they are. Indeed, the longer you stare the more you are able to
identify words and even whole phrases. For some time you sit there, almost in a trance, but each
moment that passes brings you closer to a full understanding of the markings. A little time later
and the whole message has become relatively clear. It concerns a man whose `love spurned him'
and `turned her back upon him before she,' and you're not too sure about this next bit, `shattered
like glass.' The message continues claiming that the man `worshipped' the woman but that all
she ever did was to `cut him into a thousand pieces.' Your brow creases as you try to make sense
of the odd message: the man then says that the woman `glittered and reflected him in her beauty'
but `laughed at him with her lovely faces.' You are now sure that you must be making mistakes
because how can one woman have `faces'. Suffice to say the message continues, stating,' `she
grasped me and tried to take me through'.

Take him through where?

`She laughed all the time and her faces scorned me'. The message then spirals into gibberish
until it ends with, `so I buried myself alive and took her ring with me.' A sweat breaks out on
your forehead at the thought of this final blasphemy. You stare down at the grave and realise
now just who it must belong to. It is then that you notice the barest of golden glints peeking out
from the soil. Curious, you bend down and uncover the little object, only to discover it to be a
gold ring. You pocket the artefact and stand up with a puzzled look on your face. Turn to 92.

The front door is massive and made of heavy banded black wood. Looking at the wood you
realise that it is ancient and pitted and, you don't know why, but you get the feeling that it's
always been here.

Peering closer at the wood you note that it has the images of terrified faces carved within it, each
screaming their silent screams. Above the door are a row of skulls, their black empty sockets
somehow expressive. You wonder if you dare grip the handle in front of you and take a peek
through this primeval portal.

To your left the House ends at a strong metal door entitled 'Armis'. You wonder if the metal is a
security measure to keep you out, or a defence mechanism designed to keep something in. To
your right the house continues past two southern exits, each echoing with the faint moans of the
undead, and then it enters a swirling patch of darkness.

The darkness clings to you almost caressing your skin as you march through it. Presently you
find yourself breaking free from it at last. Ahead of you the House continues past an exit and a
couple of doors. To your right it extends a very great distance, past one northern exit and ending
at another. Along that way the skull-chandeliers seem particularly old, positively ancient. The
disgusting carpet seems thicker than usual there. If you wish to continue north where you are,

At last the revolting freak is laid to rest. You look about at the remains of the Death Dragon, then
down at the glistening corpse at your feet. After this your gaze settles on the strange wavy-
bladed knife. You sure hope that this so-called 'Kris knife' was worth the effort. Bones crunch
under foot as you solemnly leave this tomb-like place and head towards the glowing portal of its
door, walking through moonlight as you do so. It's when you cross the threshold of the door that
you realise you may have made the worst mistake of your life, because your vision is quite
simply snuffed out. You simply cannot see a thing, it's as if someone has switched your eyes off.
Amidst your terrified torment a piece of you wonders if bringing the knife across the threshold of
the bone-cavern was the triggering of a final deadly trap. Regardless, you sink to your knees and
cry.

Add 1  FEAR  point and deduct 1  LUCK  point.

Several hours later you gradually stop sobbing and start to remember the friendly person who
sent you here, who warned you about some sort of 'trap' and that he would be able to help you if
you just got back to him! Whether he was telling the truth or lying you are determined to find
him once more and, even if he can't help you, you'll at least have the pleasure of killing him.

Here you are then, blinded, hopefully temporarily, but you can't say for sure. Standing up on
shaking legs, you turn your tearful face left, knowing full well that that's the way back because
you originally walked here to the right and now you must go in the exact opposite direction,
aware that any deviation could prove fatal.

On you walk then, through what you know to be the slime-filled corpse-strewn Demonspawn
area and on through the heavy iron door and past the altar area until you reach what your senses
tell you is a crossroads of tunnels.

Now you must. from your current point of view, walk either forwards, turn to 131, or left, turn to
191, or right, turn to 471.

The liquid is warm and tastes a bit like honey. After having sipped it you instantly feel
revitalised: add 2  STAMINA points! Peering closer at the bottle you reckon there's enough in it for
three more good swigs. You may drink the liquid at any time except during combat. If you do so,
you add 4   STAMINA  points for each of the three swigs and then you must discard the empty bottle

Entering the little right-angled hallway instantly causes you to shiver as the somewhat unnatural
cold soon sinks into your bones. Upon reaching the corner you peep round it and find a long
corridor peeping back at you. It has no less than four southern exits and ends at an impressive
staircase. You're just contemplating actually heading south for once when the distant moans of
the undead convince you otherwise.


Along the north wall several barred windows peer in, leaving odd striped squares of moonlight
dotted along in front of you, giving the impression you are walking through a prison. You glance
out of some of these 'prison' windows as you pass them by, taking in the distant wall of silent
trees and the ever-present feeling that they are looking back at you. Perhaps even now they are
uprooting themselves and heading in your direction, under the brooding clouds and over the
bodies of an army of dead just waiting below the surface.

Blink.

Yet again you shake these unusual thoughts from your head, wondering where they come from.
Whilst you are doing this you don't notice a tall figure step out from the stairs in front of you.
Raising your head with a start you are horrified to find an ancient bandaged mummy reaching
out to you. It is all you can do to cry out in shock before it has managed to grab hold of you. This
does not stop you attacking it with your chosen weapon. Your scalp crawls however when you
witness each wound inflicted upon it simply heal itself within seconds. The mummy sinks its
fingers into your neck and pulls you closer towards itself.

Outside a few birds are frightened away from their nests as terrified screams fill the air...

Like a man possessed, you make a blazingly fast search of your pockets, even as the writhing

thought I ashked you to leave and get the weapon?&quot; he says in exasperated tones. Then he turns
around and makes ready to slam and lock the door again. As he does you catch a small red dot on
the back of his clothes. The awful little thing soon resolves itself into a Death letter.

Gazing around the kitchen, searching for anything even remotely edible, you suddenly realise the
futility of your actions: even if you could find something in this unholy mess there'd be no way
in hell that you'd actually eat any of it. Nevertheless, you resolve to give the place a cursory
glance for something useful. You walk around the large table noticing deep cuts in the sides and,
with a shudder of horror, a fingernail embedded in a corner. Ignoring the table, you sweep your
gaze across the filth surrounding you: the cutlery with the reddish stains, the mass of entrails in
the sink, the thick layer of dirt covering everything. Then a strange though hits you; it's almost as
if the room itself were watching you.


Shaking off the unusual feeling you are just about to give up when you notice a box just peeping
out from behind a pile of slimy plates. Walking over to it you instantly discover it to be a

The mirror doesn't bother you in the slightest.

The noise of an opening door does catch your attention though.

Turning around, you are dumb-struck to find that the door you entered the Girl's room by is now
in the corner opposite where it should be. A creeping dread crawls up your spine as you look
about the room and find that everything is now in the opposite place to where it was. You have
no idea what's happened but it's as if you are now somehow in the mirror-image of the house.
Looking back in terror to the mirror you see that the door 'reflected' in it is starting to open and

The loathsome Demonspawn has been hacked to pieces but now the passage is a heaving mass of
deformed arms and heads. Only now some of the creatures have fully extracted themselves from
the slime and are staggering towards you, the first of which towers above you. It has no arms to
speak of but its entire face forms one giant open mouth. The second of these creatures is as tall as
you are but that is where the resemblance ends. Its neck ends in a stump and, instead, its horned
head protrudes from its bleeding belly. The third has two heads that constantly bite each other as
it drags its way along the wall towards you.


You get back to the door behind you, just as the creature at your feet stands straight up but
instantly collapses again as a swift blow from you sees its throat cut. However, you are suddenly
grabbed from behind by a pair of clawed hands, each of which sports a roving eye imbedded in
the back of it. You turn your head and are repulsed by an incredibly long neck projecting from
the slime and, on the end of this neck is not a head but another clawed hand complete with yet
another wandering eye. You let out a cry of horror just as the creatures in front of you close in.
Not only that but now other creatures have now almost fully extracted themselves from the
slime.

To discover how many of these things you must now face you must consult the number of
rounds it took you to defeat the previous Demonspawn and then fight that many new
Demonspawn, all of whose statistics are the same as the one below. They are slow however,
fight them one at a time.

You wrench the door open with a grunt and flinch as it smashes into the ground beside you and
sends echoes reverberating through the night. You suspect that the creatures within the House

You feel odd approaching these glassless windows, as though they were about to look through
you. Forcing down the strange feeling, you cautiously near one of the windows, aware all the
time that what lies beyond it may not be to your liking or, even worse, something may notice you
and storm the house. However, you slowly get to the window and look out across the trail, which
you notice for the first time from your elevated position, has several small pools of blood upon it,
glistening gently in the moonlight. No doubt these have been left by the poor soul you saw
running for the fence. The thought of the fence makes you crane your neck back up the path and
towards the towering spiked structure. The body of the man is still twitching slightly, but the
Messengers are nowhere to be seen.

Back to the path, you notice that, beyond the trees and sparkling in the distance is a lake. At that
moment you lean forward slightly because you could have sworn you noticed some movement in
its waters, but then realise you must have imagined it. What you do not imagine is a small island
at the centre of the lake. Looking further up the path, you can see only trees.

Then a small black object on the windowsill catches your attention: a Bible. You're rather taken
aback at having found one of these in a place like this and it sets your mind racing. Perhaps
you're not alone because someone's been here before you and tried to stop all this happening
before? Or perhaps they've already tried and this is all that's left of them. Either way you pocket
the little book and even take a little comfort in it.

At this moment you step back from the windows as a shadow passes between you and the moon:
probably just a bird.

Remembering the old legends of vampires, you quickly throw some garlic at the woman and

watch as she tumbles to the ground.

Blood dribbles down her face. Her eyes close.

The portcullis is made of iron and much too heavy for you to even consider lifting. Instead, you

Nothing you try has any affect on the door. In frustration you decide to kick it, and that's the last
mistake you'll ever make. The moment you lash out at the door you hear a click and realise that
you've set something off. Above you a secret compartment has opened and a filthy green liquid
has just started to fall. You hear a slight scraping and look up, just in time to see the mass of
gunge swamp you, entering your mouth, your nostrils, your open eyes. For just one moment, you
feel nothing. Next, in a single horrifying second, you feel the rush of utter choking, consuming
agony, as you are quite literally melted by the acid that has just covered you. It's no ordinary
substance though, for it is tainted by the horror within the house and, as your skin falls from your
body and your gurgling screams echo of the walls around you, you change. Horns sprout from
your head, your stomach bares teeth and a new eye forms in your forehead. Subsequently, you
fall to the ground both screaming and laughing, in anguish and amusement, as your face melts
and your old eyes burn. Your body melts into the floor in a puddle of green ooze, from where
you will smile and cry, awaiting with the other Demonspawn for your next victim...

Out of the blue, a bold idea to use your hipflask and its rum forms in your mind. So, painfully
slowly, you crawl round the fountain and empty the entire contents of your flask into the
creature's cup. Then you crawl into some nearby undergrowth and await the affects.

Sure enough the creature can soon be heard dragging itself up and then its misshapen form
appears from behind the statue as it lopes and shambles towards its cup. Now it reaches down,
snatches its cup up and drinks the contents, rum and all, in one go, smiling as it does so. After
this it shambles back and sits down behind the statue.


You await the inevitable for a good 20 minutes until, at last, you can hear the smiling creature
snoring. Slowly, carefully, you approach its resting place and notice a strange red ribbon covered
with religious symbols just lying on the ground next to it. Was the creature guarding it or is the
ribbon just a discarded item? Such things you may never know, but you take the red ribbon with
you, strangely comforted by its presence.

Unable to quite believe what you are doing; you almost feel like letting out a nervous laugh, but
the idea of breaking the dead silence in this house makes you inexplicably afraid. So, without a
light source, you enter the constrictive confines of the little cubbyhole under the stairs, wincing
as you move amongst the dead, feeling their cold bones against your skin, closing your eyes
against the little noises they make as they tumble over each other. As you search through the
mountain of white surrounding you, pushing in on all sides, you are startled to discover that you
cannot find the floor, or the walls, only more bone. This place must be larger than you thought or
perhaps, crazy as it sounds, it leads to the cellar, or at least it used to and is now filled up.

Filled up with bones?

Again, the urge to laugh grips you, almost physically, like the bones pushing in on you are
holding you in one giant hard hand. However, the thought that something might hear you and
close the cupboard door, leaving you in total darkness, stops you from showing any outward
signs of humour. Suddenly, you realise that you still have your eyes closed. Cursing your
stupidity or your cowardliness, you open them to find yourself still in the little, surprisingly deep
cupboard, with the door still open behind you and the skulls still looking at you.

What am I doing here?

You ask yourself.

What am I hoping to find?

Then your hands do find something, as they slide through the teeth and leg bones, they find
something soft and warm. You recall, thinking yourself to have found a fresh carcass, yet you
can hear no flies buzzing and no rats scurrying.

What is it then?

Whatever it is, is big, because no matter where you sweep your hands beneath you, all you can
find is this soft warm thing. What's more, it could be your imagination, but the floor now seems
to be sloping. You look behind you and are stunned to find the door a long way behind you.


Just how deep is this damn thing?

Just then a subtle smell starts to hit your nostrils, too weak at first to identify but, for some
reason, your senses start to scream at you to leave, but how? This place is too narrow to turn
around in and, as you attempt to do so, craning your neck behind you for the sanctuary of the
door, you let out a gasp of horror as you realise the door is now an impossibly long distance
behind you. As your gasp leaves you, you stagger slightly and almost fall into the bones around
you, putting your hand out for support and, at last touching a wall. A wall that is soft and warm.

The lid of the largest coffin is plane and there is no inscription that you can find. You brace
yourself for the effort of removing it only to find yourself surprised when it slides to one side
quite easily. Your surprise is soon eclipsed by that which lays within the coffin, for a beautiful
young woman is laying their looking for all the world as though she were sleeping! Her hair is
long and white, her skin is tanned and you could swear she had only just been placed their
because she genuinely looks as alive as you are. Even her clothes are as fresh as yours. Gazing
closer at the young woman you notice a small smile playing about her lips, almost as if she were
playing a trick on you! Leaning over her, your shadow falling across her, you place your ear near
her mouth ... for what purpose? To check if she is still breathing? It is then that you notice the
slightest flickering of her eyelids!

The woman opens her eyes and smiles at you. Then she opens her mouth and laughs quietly. Her
teeth are yellow and broken, her tongue is swollen and black. You step back as she slowly sits up
in her coffin, gripping the edges of it has she does so with fingers that have no finger nails. Your
hand over your mouth, your other hand reaching for something to defend yourself with, you then
notice that there are dozens of scratch marks within the coffin, almost as if the poor creature had
been buried alive.

Then a scream rocks you as the woman claws at her face, revealing rotten flesh below the surface
as she does so. She looks at your horrified expression and laughs, spitting blood. She then breaks
one of her own fingers and bites off part of her tongue! This woman, whatever she is, is not
human. Backing away, you gaze in terrified awe as she woman stands in her coffin and then,
your mind can scarcely believe it, sprouts a pair of rotten wings from her back! The woman
laughs at the mixture of fear and bemusement on your face, clearly she is delighted at your
ordeal. This is because she is a Fallen Angel. An evil entity that likes to torment its prey before
eating it.

It's no good. At the mere thought of having to touch the thing that is currently slithering from its
coffin, you turn your back and run to the portcullis, shaking it with all of your might and
screaming at the world. The thing behind you doesn't stop though, the rest of it flops from the
tomb, hits the floor and continues to drag and ooze its way up behind you. Even now you can


hear it dripping bits of flesh onto the floor as it pulls itself closer to you and, as you feel it rear up
directly at your back and see it cast its shadow on the ground, you suddenly stop screaming.

This is because you have just died of fright.

The thing drags your body away from the moonlight, and into darkness...

The fountain looms out of the darkness and glitters in the moonlight, its waters stirring slightly in
a light wind and on that wind screams can be heard. You look at the fountain as you near it and
note it to be a small pool of water with the statue of a woman pouring water from a jug at its
centre. You are surprised to find that the woman has wings. A movement from behind the statue
causes you to dive to the floor and hide yourself in some long grass. The movement is being
made by a large shambling misshapen creature. It's arms almost touch the ground and its head
looks like it's been mutilated to the point whereby it now just resembles a slab of raw meat.
Despite this the creature, or man, whatever it is, has a smile hidden within the flopping folds of
its face.

You look on, not daring to move, and watch as the creature reaches down, picks up a large cup
from the side of the fountain, fills the cup up with water and drinks it down in a single gulp, still
smiling as it does so. After this it replaces the cup and walks behind the statue and, judging by
the sound of it, is sitting down. You have no idea what to make of all this but decide not to
engage such a large creature bare-handed.

The mere presence of the holy items causes the creature immense pain, forcing it to emit
shocking screams that make your ears bleed. However, the moment the thing realises that you
are holding a mirror and then accidentally looks into it, causes it to turn away with its face
covered and, with one beat of its wings, throw itself upwards and smash through the dome of the
mausoleum, leaving a gaping moon-lit hole as it does so! It seems that the creature's resolve was
already weakened by the holy artefacts and that it simply couldn't stand the final shock of
realisation when it noticed what it now looks like, considering it used to be a beautiful angel.

You are covered in foul black blood and stinking green slime. But the creatures around you have
either been cut to pieces or were simply too weak or deformed to drag themselves through from
whatever Godforsaken dimension they came from. In fact some of them were so pathetically
weak to begin with that even the effort of trying to enter this world has killed them and they lie
slumped halfway through the floor or wall or hang down from the ceiling. Even so a few of the
less weak ones are still twitching pitifully so you run them through and then take a well-earned
rest.

After you have got your breath back you turn your attention to the now bloodstained door that
you originally examined. You stop momentarily though, for one of the creatures hangs helplessly
from the ceiling directly above it. It is quite dead though because you cut its stomach open in the

So you wrench the kitchen key from your pocket and ram it into the heavy padlock, praying that
you can work the rusty old thing loose before the fires die down. All the time whilst you're
struggling with the ancient lock, the moans and wails behind you serenade you with a hellish
cacophony of torment. Your hands shaking and sweating profusely, you just manage to get the
lock undone, open the door and slam it shut without even thinking of looking behind you.
Luckily, once inside you catch sight of a large iron bar on the floor and two steel rungs imbedded
into the stonework either side of the door. Grunting with effort, you lift the bar up and slam it
into the hoops, thereby affording yourself a mighty defence against the moaning zombies
outside, should they try to get in.

Horrified and not knowing what to do against such an apparition, you merely reach into your
pockets and throw the contents at it, hoping to distract it so that you can get away. By chance,
one of the objects you throw is your silver whistle which, the moment it touches the undead
creature's skin, causes it to throw its head back in agony then melt into the ground, dropping and
smashing the lamp it was carrying and leaving nothing but the rags it was wearing. Bewildered

The ghost of the old man holds up one of his hands and says with a smile, &quot;Come now my friend,
this is not the first time we've met!&quot;

The old woman nods in agreement, &quot;We've been watching over you and have agreed with each
other that you may stand a chance this time.&quot;

This time?

&quot;You've learnt so much to have got this far and you have excellent ancestral memory,&quot; muses the
ghost of the old man.

You have no idea what they are talking about and merely ask them for help.

&quot;As you may have suspected,&quot; says the old woman with a benevolent smile, &quot;there is a vampire
within these walls.&quot;

&quot;And no ordinary one,&quot; interrupts the old man, &quot;she's been in the service of Hell for centuries.&quot;

&quot;No wonder Yarles has placed so much trust in her,&quot; rejoins the ghost of the old woman, &quot;she
will be one of the last obstacles between you and Him.&quot;

You tell them that you have indeed suspected the presence of a vampire within this domain and
that you have tried your best to prepare for it.

The old man and woman laugh gently at your determined enthusiasm, &quot;Don't underestimate her,&quot;
they say together and look at each other in annoyance.

&quot;I wanted to say that bit,&quot; says the old man dejectedly.&quot;

&quot;Don't be so childish,&quot; chides the old woman.


You ask them for any other help.

The ghosts look at each other, the old man stroking his chin, the old woman playing with her
hair.

&quot;Once into the Secret room you will be met by the Questioner,&quot; states the old man in a matter-of-
fact tone.&quot;

&quot;We don't know what it is because even we can't get in there because it's protected from both the
living and the dead by the Well of Souls,&quot; says the old woman lost in thought.

You raise an eyebrow.

&quot;You should have all three of the secret numbers necessary for ingress to that place by now,&quot;
reminds the ghost of the old man. &quot;Suffice to say all we know is that the Questioner will ask you
three questions to allow you final access into Yarles' domain.&quot;

You ask them what sort of 'questions' you will be expecting to hear.

The old woman places her hands behind her back and answers, &quot;We have only learned snippets
of information because Yarles has been careful. All we can tell you for sure is that the first
question is something to do with rooms, the second is something to do with weapons and that the
third is something to do with keys.&quot;

You sigh in confusion but may still add 1        LUCK   point and deduct 2   FEAR points for this
information.

The old man looks at you and tries to comfort you with, &quot;A little knowledge is better than none.
Now we must leave you.&quot;

&quot;Good luck,&quot; says the ghost of the old woman as the couple fade from view, &quot;we won't see you
again,&quot; leaving you alone with nothing but the moans of the dead far below.

You are elated for a few moments upon opening the 'Saltare' door. This is because it leads into a
brightly-lit ballroom full of dancing people. Your elation soon leaves when you spot that there is
no music and that all of the well-dressed people are dancing in silence, apart from the swish of
the ladies' dresses. This unnerving disappointment soon leads to a spine-crawling feeling when
you look closer at the people and realise that all of the male partners in each dancing duo are
dead. Of course their bodies' have been reanimated by some demonic power and are even now
forced to move to and fro with their heads slumped onto their rotten chests and their black
tongues lolling from their mouths.

The dancing women each stare silently with tearful eyes at their male partners. A sudden dread
grips you when you understand that each of the women's dancing partners may well be their
husbands

You are disappointed that you can find nothing more of interest with the gravestone and proceed
to walk around it. Just as you are doing this you gasp in horror because, around the other side of
the gravestone and slumped against it, is the wrinkled, diseased-ridden corpse of an old hag!


Your heart bursting in surprise, it is a wonder you did not cry out with shock. Instead, you take a
sickening moment to take a cursory glance at the bony old wretch at your feet, taking in her
incredibly long, filthy grey hair, the pathetic rags that adorn her and, most alarming of all, the
impossibly long nails of her fingers. You are just about to turn away when you notice a small key
clasped to a chain, just visible beneath her matted hair. The idea of actually touching this
disgusting creature turns your stomach and yet you can't help feeling that the key might prove
useful.

Without the Spear of Destiny the Doom Demon is invulnerable and you are lost. All you can do

down upon you, breaking ever bone in your body...

Approaching the bodies apprehensively you reach out and give the tattered covers about them a
gentle prod. Nothing happens. You cautiously nudge one of them and prepare to leap back but
still nothing happens. The bodies are apparently just that: inanimate corpses and not a pair of
bloodthirsty zombies as you'd half expected. With a sigh at what you are about to do, you set
about carefully and shamefully searching the clothes of the dead.

After a mere minute you've emptied their rotting pockets and have found nothing but dust and a
few moth balls. It is with disappointment that you stop your search. Then you notice something
that the male corpse has tightly grasped in its decomposing hand and that something can only be
described as a wooden stake. You tilt your head to one side and remember that this is not the first
time you've suspected the presence of a vampire somewhere within this house of pain.

At that moment you jump out of your skin as the door behind you slams so hard that the room
shakes and dust is thrown into the air. In this event the head of the man's corpse has been
disturbed and turned to look at you. Your eyes meet with its shrivelled blackened eye sockets
and you can't help but shiver. Hoping against hope that the door was merely the wind or hell's
idea of a joke, you turn your back on it and your eyes down to the stake. If you attempt to take
the stake, turn to 296. If you'd rather investigate the desk, turn to 187. If you'd rather look out of

This roar is so loud that it causes several chunks of rock to loosen from the ceiling and smash to

around you fades and the world explodes into colour again and you are looking down a corridor
with a few northern exits.

Unfortunately for you there is a strange shimmering man-like creature blocking the path. It
glimmers and flickers in front of you giving it a hazy half-real image as if it were composed of

Inching closer to the window, you place your nose against the glass and peer between the bars
into the darkened space beyond. All you can make out are the vague definitions of furniture. You
breathe a sigh of relief. Then you notice a large patch of shadow on the floor and yet you can't
make out what's casting it. Then the patch moves. Your breathing quickens as you watch the
shadows twisting and writhing into odd shapes. You don't know whether it's a trick of the light or
whether it's all in your mind, but the motion of the shadows makes you feel sick; there is clearly
something very wrong in what you are looking at and your senses scream at you to get way.

Even as you reach for the door it opens soundlessly of its own accord. Beyond it lays the House,
yet everything is wrong: the skulls are on the floor, the furry carpet is on the ceiling and the
stalactites and stalagmites are on the walls. The doors are where the windows should be and are
all barred. The windows are of course where the doors should be and are all made of thick wood.
Astounded to the point where you are no longer thinking correctly, you take but a single step into
that place and discover that even the echo of that one single footfall sounds eerie, as if it were
being played in reverse.

As if in answer to the solitary sound of your one step, the walls about you start to bleed, except
that the blood is flowing upwards. Then all of the runes about you start to glow and then the
whole scene shimmers between red and white whilst the walls seem to shift about you as
everything starts alternating between light and darkness.

Whilst contemplating this place of wrongness, you are suddenly pushed from behind by several
strong hands and end up smashing into a stalactite opposite you. Dazed but curiously unhurt you
get up and are at first bewildered to note that the door you entered this place by is no longer there
and then horrified when the sounds of distorted screams echo in reverse around you. As if this
weren't enough, several long thin arms are snaking through the shadows from multiple
directions.

Add 1  FEAR point.

You must try to find a way to escape from here, assuming such a way exists. Ignoring the chaos
twisting and squirming around you, you put your back to where the Girl's door should have been

corridor flowing in what you assume to be in a horizontal fashion, turn to 459 to go this way. To
what you imagine to be the south you spy an extremely long corridor that extends far to the south

Once through the door you are forced to step back a little because of the heat and fumes. This is
because you have just stepped into what probably used to be some sort of sauna or suchlike
room, considering that it has a large stone step in the background, several white towels and a
metal stand full of hot coals. All of this is irrelevant compared to the two closed and burning
sunbeds to the left and right of the room. Even they themselves are meaningless compared to the
two screaming souls trapped within them.

You try to fight your way to the flames and consider breaking open the beds, only to be met with
thick chains and massive padlocks without keys. Hardening your heart, you are determined to
make Yarles suffer for this latest evil. As you are about to leave you notice a bottle of suntan
lotion on the floor, ordinary looking except that it's marked as 'flammable'. Assuming this to be
another example of hell's sick sense of humour, you take it anyway hoping you can put it to good
use. Closing the door and drowning out the screams of torture, you are back in the passage you'd
just left.

water crosses your mind. You start to shake and sweat forms on your forehead, you find yourself
rooted to the earth and staring into the silvery water. This water, with the island at its centre

every available seat is full of goat-masked people all punching the air or spitting down at you. As
well as these people there are other less distinct images wavering between some of them here and
there: horns, claws, mouths for faces, tongues down to their stomachs.

A scraping sound causes you to look over to the far side of the arena and notice two massive
gates opening. Out of these gates streams two lines of hellish monstrosities. Each line stops just
short of you and then turns to face one another.

A tall man with black hair moves between them. His image, like the demons in the audience is
hazy and indistinct. He stops at the centre of the lines of horrors and his image wavers. He
speaks. His voice is strangely stilted, almost robotic, like a recording that's been played many
times, &quot;To access the final domains of this House requires a test to judge the interloper's worth. If
this test is passed, then according to the rules which we all abide by the outsider may pass.&quot;

At these words there is a smattering of knowing laughter around the audience.

The strange man continues, &quot;Let the interloper now be tried.&quot;

The audience cheers.

&quot;You'll note that each of our warriors here has a number stamped on it.&quot;

You look at the grisly army and have to admit that the man's word's ring true. On both sides each
creature has a single number on it from '3' to '18'.

&quot;The outsider will throw the dice at his feet a total of three times.&quot;

You look down at the ground and notice a trio of bone dice with skulls representing the numbers
on them.

&quot;I will have the honour of throwing the dice for us.&quot;

There is more cheering and a great deal of clapping at these words.

&quot;Whatever number the outsider throws with the dice shall correspond with the line to the right.
Whatever dice I throw shall correspond with the line to the left. Both lines are identical neither of
us shall have an advantage.&quot;

There is more laughter at this.


&quot;When we've both rolled our dice a total of three times and have randomly selected our
combatants the interloper shall decide which one of their creatures fights which one of ours. If
the interloper rolls the same number twice they shall reroll the dice until they get a different
number until they have three unique creatures on their team. I shall do the same.&quot;

You stand there aghast just listening to all of these strange instructions hoping you can remember
all of the rules.

&quot;If the outsider's first creature kills our first creature it may continue to fight the second or even
the third if it survives. If our first creature beats theirs, then it may continue to fight the second
and even the third likewise, should it survive. The outsider must fight any of our creatures that
remain should all of his perish. The outsider may face them one by one should this come to pass
but may not intervene whilst any of their creatures still live.&quot;

You raise an eyebrow at this.

&quot;If the interloper's creatures kill all of ours without the interloper's help then so be it. We shall
not think any less of the interloper than we already do.&quot;

There is an outbreak of laughter and much slapping of thighs at this. Even the wavering forms of
some of the demons' shoulders are shaking a little.

&quot;Like I have already said and to remind the outsider; they may decide the order that the creatures
fight each other.&quot;

Now you must roll the three dice three times for him and consult the following table, rerolling
whenever you roll a creature he's already got on his team. If you don't like any of the rolls you
may Test your Luck and if Lucky, reroll the dice.

Once through the blue door you are greeted with a bathroom complete with toilet, sink and of

The door slides open on exceedingly well-oiled hinges and leads you into an artist's studio. There
are paintings set on easels, half-finished canvases along the walls and several life-sized
sculptures of models in the room. The floor is covered in a rainbow of paint and there are a

You open the cupboard and are startled to find it full of bones. A closer examination reveals that
they used to belong to rats, dogs, cats, foxes, birds, rabbits and just about any other common

its fangs and snarls as it rakes its long claws along the wall as it stalks towards you.

The thick door creaks open and leads you into what can only be a gym. There are rowing
machines, treadmills and various weight training machines. Each and every one of them a person
upon it who is, quite literally, working themselves to death. Indeed, several of them have already
died of exhaustion or cramp and are simply sprawled out about the room and left to rot.

Everywhere you look are signs of agony and grunts of pain as, even as you watch, a young man
collapses from a bike machine and dies in front of you. There is a large mirror at the back of the
room showing the scene as it is except that it depicts within its reflection a room of long dead
and shrivelled corpses. It also shows a point of red which soon resolves into a Death Letter.

Your legs make swishing sounds as you wade through the fur-carpet and make your way to the
right north exit. Once there you march on under the stalactites and get the distinct and rather odd
impression that they are ancient, older than the earth itself. Shaking off the strange feeling, you
discover a long dark junction to the right, unlit by any light source, yet riddled with barred
windows that let in a little moonlight. Looking down the passage you get the creeping feeling
that it's looking back at you. This passage continues on for a way and has a north-south exit just

You now pass freely through the 'Secret door' just as the corridor behind you becomes
unbearably hot because, to your astonishment, the Wall of Blood, Room of Shadows and Well of
Souls have been replaced by the original corridor you walked along and that corridor is now full
of fire. This must be because time passed strangely whilst you were being questioned or whilst
you were traversing the strange Rooms that led to the Questioner. Whatever the reason the fire
has now took over this floor of the House. You shudder, close the door and take a good look at
this so-called 'Secret Room'.

Your eyes widen with a mixture of utter disbelief and pure abhorrence.

The floor here is composed of dozens of people all stitched together to form one giant writhing
mass. The ceiling is similarly decorated and is sending down a wash of blood. Finally, the walls
are in eerie paradox to the rest of the room, in that they are covered in nothing more than
expensive-looking wallpaper. This paper sports a weird wavy orange mosaic, almost giving off
the impression of fire.

There is no exit from this room.

In front of you a man is standing regarding you whilst a smile plays on his lips. He is wearing a
grey suit and a brown tie. He is short and rotund. He has close-cropped ginger hair and sports a
thin moustache on his cheerful red-cheeked face. &quot;My name is Yarles,&quot; he says in a voice pitched


to high for a man of his girth, &quot;Lord Yarles to be exact,&quot; he says with a bow. &quot;And I am at your
service!&quot; he adds with a jolly laugh.

The physical appearance of the man you have been seeking for so long leaves you dumbfounded
in its ordinariness. This is not to mention his jovial manner and general politeness. Then you
remember his butler who was one of his most trusted servants and who also happened to be a
Hell Demon.

&quot;A pleasure to meet you,&quot; he offers with an outstretched hand.

Of course you ignore this gesture.

Yarle's smiled broadens still further when he reminds you that, &quot;Politeness costs nothing!&quot;

You can't help yourself. You spit at him. The smile from his face fades and he produces a curved
sacrificial dagger complete with what looks like a handle wrapped in human skin from inside his
suit. &quot;You have done well I'll admit,&quot; he says through a now obviously fake smile, &quot;Hell has put
so many obstacles in your way and we have even bent some of our rules to accommodate you.
Perhaps we have even broken one or two. Nevertheless, a way was always open to you
regardless of how narrow and difficult it was. That is one rule we never break.&quot;

You say nothing to all this. Instead you just brandish the first 'secret' in his face and tell him that
it used to belong to a friend of his.

Once more the smile fades from Yarle's face, &quot;He was my most trusted ally!&quot; he says, his voice
rising, &quot;A dear friend and an excellent warrior!&quot;

You tell him that the Hell Demon was a coward and a wretch and that you gained immense
satisfaction from sending it back to the pit.

&quot;How dare you speak that way about him!&quot; he answers you with a shout. &quot;And how dare you
speak like that to me! I am a Lord!&quot;

You tell him that he's a worm, just like his brother.

At that last comment Yarle's shouts in rage and attacks you with his dagger. You defend
yourself.

Wandering through flowers a slight trepidation tugging at your mind, you come closer to the
refuse pile and realise it is glistening in the moonlight. It is also moving, and moaning. On closer
inspection and with wide round eyes, you understand why. It's not a refuse pile at all but a living,

Carefully, you make your way to the chess set and instantly notice that the pieces are not ivory at
all, but bone. Indeed all of the pawns are made of finger bones. Disgusted at yet another travesty
that Yarles is accountable for, you make ready to smash the set, but something stops you. Before
your eyes the pieces start to move of their own accord. Then, to your further astonishment, two
ghostly figures appear, an old man and woman. Dressed in clothes that went out of fashion ages
ago and with hairstyles that would be considered slightly ridiculous in this day and age, they are
not actually frightening at all.

You watch them play for a while and then feel a cold chill creep down your spine as both the
figures turn to you and smile.

'Do not be afraid,' says the old man with knowing look, 'we are not here to hurt you.'

'We know who you are and know why you're here,' says the old woman with a grin. 'You are
here to stop Yarles.'

You are dumbfounded but refuse to confirm or deny.

'We were his parents,' says the old man whilst nodding at his wife. 'Hard to believe I know.'

'But true, agrees the woman.' Then she fixes you with a black-eyed stare. 'You are in terrible
danger.'

You shrug your shoulders at this as if to say how obvious her statement is.

'Not just you, she continues, but everybody. Yarles is attempting to open something he's referred
to as 'The Gate'. We don't know what it is or where it leads but it must be far from good.'

'He's already tried it once,' agrees the old man, stroking his chin, 'but all he succeeded in doing
was bringing some sort of Presence here from God-knows where. Luckily, it seems dormant at
the moment and confined to this House.'

'The Presence is the least of our worries if he manages to open that Gate and brings through
whatever it is that's waiting on the other side.'

You can contain yourself no longer and blurt out asking them if they can help you, a touch
angrily, all your concern washing away.

The old man raises his eyebrows but his voice remains level when he answers you. 'Yarles is
protected in his Secret Room and to open this room you'll need three pieces of information. As to
where this room is, it's the last in the house on the floor above As for how to open it or what's in
it or what and where the secret information is, we don't know'

You don't know whether to be angry or grateful.


The woman smiles at you and says, 'he would've entrusted these secrets only to those closest to
him.'

'He has several bodyguards too,' interrupts the old man, 'and none of them will be easy to pass.
Only very rarely will direct combat prevail.'

'That's how his mind works,' interjects the woman. 'This House, these grounds, all of it, it's one
giant puzzle. That's how hell works, it's all a game and all the pieces are present and in play.
There is a way to beat hell at this game because it always provides a way otherwise it breaks its
own rules.'

'Won't be easy,' says the old man with a yawn and then he and his wife begin to fade away.
'Sorry, but there's something else here and it's waking up.'

You stare through their fading figures until only the chess set remains. Somewhat flustered but
still quite happy that you have something to go on nevertheless, you turn your attention back to

tearing itself open so that a giant tooth-filled mouth is now apparent as she calmly rips her
clothes away from it. From within this maw two further arms are pushing themselves forward.
As if that weren't enough, you can make out the terrified face of the original woman staring out
at you from the confines of those jaws. As for the 'other' face the woman once had, it has now
been split asunder and ruined to be replaced by a writhing nest of tentacles.


Add 1  FEAR  point.

If you suffer from Dysmorphophobia you must add a        FEARpoint and deduct 1 from your Attack
Strength. If it's your Primal Fear you must add 3     FEARpoints instead and deduct 3 points from
your Attack Strength instead.

Regardless, at the start of each combat round you must Test your Fear and if Fearful gain a    FEAR
point because the woman's transformation is ongoing and is becoming even more horrifying.

With a sudden jerk of your body, you throw the creature off you and make ready to run for the
boat. The hag is surprised but only for a second, but that second is all she needs to hurl herself at
you, but you have the advantage and dive to one side, just as the bony hag throws herself at you,
claws just missing your face. You get up from the floor and are suddenly momentarily paralysed
as the Banshee once more lets out a sickeningly loud scream that threatens to cut you in tow or
drive you insane. Shielding your ears against the uproar you are just in time to notice the
creature's muscles bunch as she squats in the dirt mere meters away from you, evidently getting
ready for another leap at your throat. In less than a second you are running for the boat and for
salvation, with the creature diving at your exposed back. Test your Luck. If you are Lucky, turn

You grope your way forwards and end up in a pleasant-smelling area. A slight chink of bottles,
accidentally jogged by your arm reminds you that you're now back in the wine cellar. You call
for the little man but your only response is loud snoring. Arms-outstretched, you slowly make
your way to the old man and give him a shake but it's no good because he's drunk himself

The door opens before you can touch it and then disappears. At the same time the darkness
around you fades and the world explodes into colour again and you are soon looking down a
corridor with a few northern exits.

Unfortunately a large armoured skeleton is blocking your progress. It has a sword with a snake
carved around its hilt and a shield with a lion motif upon it. You suspect that these animated
yellowed old bones probably used to belong to a warrior.

The skeleton regards you with its black eye sockets and then attacks.

Wrenching the torch from your pocket you shine it right at one of the giant creature's eyes,
instantly causing it to recoil from both you and the boat. It does not leave however, but rather it
regards you from a distant, eyes narrowed; tentacles gliding tentatively towards you. You will
have to row like a madman if you are to escape this creature and yet you are only half way across
the lake to begin with. Not only this but you will have to hold torch in your teeth and do your
best to keep it aimed at the eyes of the huge creature, that even now starts to glide towards you,
wary of the light perhaps but already growing used to it. This will be a monumental task and you

Thankful to leave the fog behind, you stride ahead. Except that now you get the feeling that the
walls are looking at you. Ignoring them as best you can, you walk onwards, avoiding any
particularly long stalactites. Then you enter an impossibly long corridor that stretches far to you
left and right. The faint smell of burning reaches you here, as well as inhuman moans. You
wonder how far the fire has took hold and how many of the dead have survived it.

Diving under the billiard table, just as a cue prepares a savage strike at your face, you become
momentarily partially protected from the rain of blows thundering around you. An ominous
creak causes you to look up. The billiard table is breaking in two. You roll to one side just before

Your footsteps echo as you enter the long dark passage, making it seem as though there's more
than one of you walking through here. Indeed on several occasions you have to turn around to
check that you are still alone. All you see though is the light source from the last nest of hanging
skulls dwindling in the distance. At last you reach the section of the 'tunnel' where it bends north.
Here there is a window and you are just contemplating investigating it when a huge white object
crashes past it outside. Startled, you resolve to leave the window well alone.

Following the passage as it turns northwards you are happy to discover its well-lit exit up ahead.
There you pass into what looks like a forward facing hallway with a left-facing one at its start.

You grasp the handle of the door and pull it toward you only to be met by one of the most
horrifying sights that hell has to offer. Standing in front of you is a man-sized creature that is
anything but human, for it is utterly swarming with rats, so much so that you can barely see what
they are crawling on. Suffice to say, what ever it is seems totally unperturbed by the vermin that
swarm over it and just steps through into the kitchen and closes the door behind itself. Now that
it is in the kitchen's light you can make out a further horror because the thing's stomach lays
open and its intestines are spilling out, causing it to leave a trail of slime wherever it goes.
Further more, to your absolute disbelief, there are more rats crawling about within its stomach.

Add 1  FEAR  point.

You hold your own stomach as the thing, its body an ever-changing mass of writhing movement,
walks calmly towards you and extends its arms out so that it might grasp you. At least this is
what you first think until you realise that it means to fight you because it is brandishing a meat


cleaver and a carving knife. You can now hazard a guess that this appalling, inhuman thing you
now face is the chef. You can only guess at your fate should you lose to it.

You are in a short section with a door to your left and one to your right. Ahead of you is a
horizontal passage and, what you assume must be, the front door. The left door is marked
'Accipere' and is richly worked with dark wood and a shiny brass handle. The right door is

If not, you move on.

As soon as you start to walk down this long cold passage your footsteps echo around you,
sometimes giving the impression that you're being followed. The passage seems empty though,
entirely devoid of anything, even light. So much so that at its midsection it could almost be that
you are floating in shadow. At last you reach its end and discover a t-junction. To your left is
what can only be described as a swirling patch of solid darkness which you certainly don't fancy
entering. In front of you is what you assume to be the outer wall of the house and another t-
junction there. To your right is a brightly-lit corridor with the usual lush red carpet and expensive
chandeliers. This direction passes several doors before turning north.

Walking through into the right room you suddenly comprehend the mental image of three
raggedly-dressed figures cursing you whilst slowly disappearing downwards into darkness.

You hazard a guess you have just beaten the Messengers of Death at their own game and that
you won't be bothered by them ever again.

Add 2   LUCK points and deduct 2  FEAR  points.

Glad to be rid of the Messengers once and for all, you leave the study with a renewed sense of
purpose. The study then leads onto a sumptuously decorated space with a soft white carpet and
rich blue wallpaper. Adorning the wall are many beautiful tapestries that depict strange scenes of
a bald-headed eyeless monster eating children. Situated elsewhere in the area are comfortable
and obscenely expensive chairs, all antique-looking and carved with various images of skulls.

There is one exit from here and that is to the south and heavily padlocked. Besides this exit on a
large golden sofa is a black-haired woman also dressed in black and dripping with pearls. Her
hair is straight and so long that it extends to her waste. Her skin is pale yet her lips are blood red.


She gets off the sofa and walks model-like over to you where she fixes you with sultry green
eyes. She is the most beautiful woman you have even seen and despite your better judgement
you relax your guard, even in this place.

&quot;No need to worry,&quot; she says in a soft whispering voice, &quot;just look into my eyes and listen to my
voice.&quot;

Unable to turn away and unable to ignore her you do as she asks. Her light voice flows over you
and through you. Her eyes draw you in and you want to be there.

Where?

But the thought is washed away and you sway a little, your eyelids drooping.

&quot;Sit upon the sofa,&quot; she purrs in your ears. She leads you to it and holds your hand as you sit
down. You are too sleepy to notice how cold she is. &quot;Just relax and sleep because there's
something I want to show you.&quot; Her voice is inside your head now.

This means that as you drift away you don't notice a wicked smile dawn on her face.

&quot;I want to show you a memory,&quot; she continues, barely audible, her voice causing you to shiver.
&quot;But not a very pleasant one!&quot; she adds with delight, clapping her hands. &quot;So easy to hypnotise!
Now, sit back and sleep and let me look into your mind.&quot;

You feel her within your memories, probing, feeling, looking for something choice. You don't
care, you are where you want to be and could quite happily die in her arms.

&quot;You must face something you've already faced, or, perhaps I shall plant a false memory in your
little mind!&quot; she laughs and the sound is like warm water submerging you. You sleep.

The woman jumps up and claps her hands girlishly. &quot;Now then my dear, let's see what horror I
can cause you to face once more!&quot;

With her last words you can feel your mind being pulled back in time to an event you've been
through, to an opponent you've already beaten, assuming the memory she activates isn't a false
one; but there's nothing you can do and her hypnosis is very strong. Besides, you still want to
please her.

Now you must make a note of this reference and then roll three dice and consult the following
table. You must then go there and face the thing you've already faced. Once there you must
follow the reference and do as it says right up to and including the fight with the monster that
will be there.

The light is full of laughter and the crying of people pleading you to go back and of others urging
you forward, of terror and elation of hope and pain. Desperate to be out of this horrible
kaleidoscope, you march forward to break free of it and swiftly find another horizontal passage,
almost bumping into an enormous rune-carved stalactite looking like a colossal tooth. Around it
the walls change rapidly from red to white.

The entrance to the secret garden is a small wooden child-sized door almost completely hidden
by moss and ivy. The door sits in the in a rickety old pock-marked wall. The wall is certainly
quite high, but not high enough to hide the things beyond it completely.

You duck down and push the door open, wincing as its rusty hinges scream into the night.
Quickly, you bend down even further, walk through and shut the old door behind you.

The garden is full of flowers, bushes, statues and water features but everything is completely
overgrown. All about you lies beauty, and yet there's something tugging at your mind, telling
you to leave this place. Ignoring the urge to flee, you look around and make an examination of
the place. To the north is the fountain you noticed earlier. To the east is the greenhouse. To the
north-east is an impressively large man-made waterfall. To the south is a refuse pile. To the
south-east a bonfire has been lit, presumably for burning the refuse.

Still shaken by sight of the Horned Demon, you quickly turn left and quietly make your way
around the side of the house, trying your best to ignore the black portals of its windows as you do
so. It's only after you've taken a few more steps and passed another window that it suddenly
dawns on you that you are not even sure why you are avoiding looking into any of the windows
you've been passing. Turning your head slightly, all you see are the dark interior recesses of
rooms barely outlined in shadows.

Why have you been avoiding their stares? And why are you thinking of these rooms as capable
of staring?

Stopping for a moment, you turn your head further and look up at this whole House. It stretches
above you and, the more you look, the more you get the dizzying feeling that it's growing. You
shake your head and recover your resolve. The House, in many respects, looks normal. The
bricks certainly are and the mortar that holds them in place does not look unusual, even the
windows that you've been avoiding are comprised of ordinary glass and ordinary wooden

Wondering at the danger of what you're doing you accidentally fumble and drop your key which
lets out quite an echo off the stone floor. As if in answer to this sound you soon become aware of
the scrape of a key in a lock and the grind of stone as the door is thrown open. You lash out as
voices and laughter reverberate around you but you simply cannot hope to fight blind, let alone
against two or three foes. Rough hands grab you and you are quickly disarmed and then
wrenched along the tunnel and into another room by the sounds of things. Presently you are
thrown bodily onto a table and, judging by the feel of things, chained here. Now the laughing
voices disappear and a slam of a door is heard. Quiet footsteps pad towards you and a gleeful
voice can be heard in your ear, 'A pity you won't see what I'm about to do to you because I
normally leaves the eyes till last. Still, at least you'll be able to feel.' The air is now filled with
metallic sounds and the spluttering of a torch. 'Forgive me,' says the sneering voice, 'but I always

hands behind her back and forced into a kneeling position with further chains around her neck, is
the body of a woman who's been forced to endure a horrific death. The chains binding her have
been bound in such a fashion as to force her face down into the indescribable filth filling the

The smell gets stronger, the door is behind, but the stench hits you from the front: rotting flesh.
Turning back from the door, you find yourself actually staring down a long, bone-filled tunnel,
dipping dramatically into nothing but darkness. It is from that darkness that the filthy rotten
smell is coming from. The warm floor below you convulses, as do the walls, causing bones to
rain down upon you, smothering you, hitting you, biting you.

You wrench your head above the surface and are startled to find that you can stand up, in this
sloping tunnel you are in, walled in by bone on all sides though you are. Even as you stand
though, you feel another lurch and feel the entire world dip behind you, pouring skulls into that
blackness you can no longer bare to look at. You run then, as best you can, fighting your way
through leg bones, arm bones and jaw bones, all the while the stench getting stronger. Just then,
something erupts from the bones ahead of you, no, it is the bones themselves that have leapt up,
joining, and connecting, until they at last reveal some semblance of a man, chalk-white,
brimming with skulls and teeth, armoured with rib cages and spines. The thing leaps at you and
you must fight your way past it, to the door behind it, a pathetic point of white, light years from
either of you.

If your suffer from Cartilogenophobia, you must, due to the added fear this creature causes, add
1 to your   FEARscore. You must also deduct 1 from your Attack Strength for this encounter if it is

Exhausted and confused, you decide to sit on the sofa and watch the decapitated body for a

The long corridor stretches away to your left and, once again, you get the unshakable feeling that
it's simply too long to actually fit inside the house. Regardless, you tread on, under the watchful
gaze of the skulls above you.

Some way along the hall the skull-lights behind you start to snuff out from a breeze you've just
felt. You start to run from the encroaching darkness until you realise that the same thing is
happening ahead of you too, until just one final nest of lighted skulls above you goes out, leaving
you in utter blackness. If you have a burning torch, turn to 82. If you don't, turn to 130.

Feeling you have spent more than enough time in this god forsaken tomb, you resolve to leave it
right now and start to make your way back to the portcullis. A shock is sent through you though
when you realise that there is a large creature standing just outside the tomb and that it seems to
be looking straight at you. The reason you only think it's looking right at you is because the thing
is entirely wrapped from head to foot in bloody bandages. Standing there, you stare,
dumbfounded at this new horror. The creature reaches out to the bars and grabs them, shaking
them with such strength that it sends down a wash of dust from above you. It seems this menace
is intent on pulling the entire steel portcullis from its hinges! Such a display of strength causes
you to back away quickly and look about you for another means of escape: the walls? The floor?
The ceiling? Of course! The Fallen Angel has left a gaping hole just a few feet above you, and
with the help of a nearby tomb you manage to climb up to the hole.

The creature behind you seems to realise what you are attempting because it redoubles its
attempts to break in and even succeeds in shaking the entire mausoleum in its struggles. You
take a last look at the bloodied, godless thing, and surmise that it's wrapped in its own funeral
shroud and probably not in the best of moods. You pull yourself through the hole above you just
as you hear the portcullis begin to scrape open. You have no intention of ever facing a creature
possessing the might to be able to do such a thing.

On top of the mausoleum, you resolve to leave this graveyard as quickly as possible, hoping that
the horror below you is not as fast as it is strong. Turn to 279.

The door falls from its hinges as you push it open but the incredibly thick carpet absorbs most of
the noise.

The inside is full of the sounds of crying and muffled screams. You soon realise why. Although
the room is decorated in an almost startlingly normal manner with a normal carpet and boring
wallpaper that is where the normality ends. All of the furniture inside this place: the light fittings,
the chairs, the tables and the curtains, are made of still living people or of their skin.

The 'chairs' and 'tables' writhe in unbelievable agony as they have been nailed together and
wound with barbed wire to form their horrible shapes. The lights are human arms and even their
lamp shades are made of skin.

Spinning like a top and making for the now empty doorway you observe a small red dot above its
frame. Within seconds it becomes a Death Letter.

You walk but a few more steps and bump straight into the outstretched arms of the Horned
Demon. At least that's what you assume it to be, what with the smell of brimstone and the
overwhelming fear that has just drenched you. The demon grabs you and wrenches your head
right around so that whilst you are facing forwards, your head is facing backwards. Your death
is instantaneous. You are surprised then to suddenly 'wake up', still blind however, and find
yourself in what sounds like a vast cavern or cave system, filled with the echoing screams of men
and women, as well as the sounds of clinking chains and the smell of burning. You can't see
anything but, as your heart is consumed with petrifying fear, you realise that you still know
exactly where you are...

Your are just about to leave the old hag's corpse when, impossibly, she whips her head around to
look at you! You feel your heart stop as you stare into those to black hate-filled eyes as you take
in the hideously twisted furious visage, not to mention a gaping mouth so side that she could
easily place both of her hands inside it. Then the creature lets out an incredibly loud scream that
rocks you to the core, practically splitting your skull and almost bursting your eardrums.

This creature is a Banshee: an undead monstrosity that takes the form of a weak old woman to
lure in passers-by. A very dangerous and deceptively powerful foe at the best of times but,
befitted as you are, you are hardly in a position to actually do battle with this hellish, screaming

eyes willing yourself to die before it touches you. Maggots start to fall on your skin, sickening

The smell of the dead gets stronger as you push the door open almost painfully slowly. After
you've done this a stuttering voice suddenly rings out, 'Is that y-you? I d-don't b-believe it!'

Then a friendly hand is placed on your shoulder and you are led blindly into a warm room filled
with the smell of incense. You are lead to and made to sit in a comfortable feeling armchair.


'W-well, I s-said to my friend that I'd help y-you and I w-will,' says the affable voice, with more
than a touch of concern.

The sound of a vessel being filled with liquid reaches your ears before a somewhat hot glass is
placed into your hands.

'D-drink this and y-you'll feel b-better I promise y-you.'

In your current predicament you don't really have a choice. Upending the vessel into your mouth
you feel a soothing yet tasteless liquid warm your throat. For a few minutes nothing happens and
your heart sinks.

'Give it t-time,' says the friendly voice.

Then it happens.

You're rocked with a convulsing sensation in your stomach and sent crashing to the floor. Your
ears fill with the sounds of rushing blood; and sparkles penetrate the darkness surrounding you.
Rolling on the floor, clutching your stomach, you're only dimly aware of the friendly voice
saying something to you, '... p-pass soon, all b-be over...'

The world around you explodes into light and colour. You can see again! You can feel the Fear
spell leave you.

Add 1   LUCK point and deduct 2   FEAR points. You may also regain up to 7  STAMINA  points because

Pained but smiling, you take in the unfamiliar broken nose of the old grinning servant, the
untouched and smartly decorated room about you, with its black leather armchairs, nicely carved
table, rich blue wallpaper and bright cheerful chandelier. Right now it's the best room you've
ever seen in your life. Laughing, you ask the man how on earth you can ever repay him?

'The b-best thing y-you can d-do is d-deal w-with that coward Y-yarles!'

You laugh at this and ask him that surely you can do something to help him personally?

The old servant just laughs at this and says, 'Killing Y-yarles w-will b-be more than enough!'

You slap him on the back and tell him that you'll be sure to do your best. After a couple more
minutes further discussion, you become aware again of the moans of the dead and the stench that
accompany them.

'W-we must leave here and get t-to the b-butler right now.'

You agree with him, assuming that this 'butler' is the holder of the first 'secret' and is therefore
one of Yarles' most trusted allies.

Within a heartbeat you are being lead out of the door, down to the south and then right and along
the corridor that leads to the stairs to the second floor. Within a few yards you've arrived at a
well polished wooden door embossed with carvings of souls being dragged into hell and
embossed with a shiny plaque and the legend 'Infernum.'

'This is his d-door.'

You gaze at it, noting its incredible thickness and the sheer size of it, not to mention the giant
keyhole and enormous handle. If you possess the Butler's key, turn to 367. If you do not, turn to

The urge to run grips you as you move closer to the corner of the House and closer to the
muffled screams. As you move nearer you become aware of the flapping of wings. When you are
at the corner of the House you take a deep breath and compose yourself for a few moments. It is
when you are doing this that your eyes settle on the dark shapes of the trees that ring the house.
Their twisted forms still unnerve you. It is honestly like some of them are alive. No. It is like
they are all alive, all watching you, a hundred of them, constantly staring at you, scrutinising
you, but are they friends or foes? The dead ones look like foes, all skeletal and misshaped, bent
double, or hiding their faces with their limbs, looking for all the world like they'd uproot
themselves in an instant and come crawling towards you.

Blink.

You snap out of it and turn your attention back to the corner of the House and the muffled
screams that are just beyond it. Taking a deep breath, you peer round the wall and see a sight that
looks like it's been torn from hell.

Just in front of you, there is a burned husk of a large tree and a man chained to it. Around this
man and hanging from every one of the black tree's limbs, are dozens of burned corpses. It is
difficult to see the man that is still alive though because he is swamped in a heaving mass of
crows that are eating him. The man cannot scream properly because his mouth has been sewn
shut. This doesn't stop him from thrashing his head about in a vain attempt to dislodge the
gorging birds as they tear strips of flesh from his writhing body. At some places they have
already eaten through to his bones so that the odd flashes of white can be seen through the
glistening swathes of red. His eyes have already been pecked out. The sight of all of this sickens
you but it also angers you for surely no one is deserving of such an appalling punishment? This
feeling strengthens your resolve. If you want to scare away the crows, turn to 380. If you want to

Outside the Armis room you face the long hallway stretching to your right again, noting as you
did before the odd patch of squirming darkness at its midsection. Ignoring a jolt of fear, you take
a step or two forwards and quickly discover yourself at the incredibly thick front door again.

above it, you wonder if you should risk trying the door after all. You may do this if you have not

Without warning you find yourself paralysed and can only watch in shock as three ragged figures
step out of the shadows around you and begin to converge on you. Each of these figures looks at
you through puss-filled eye-sockets and smiles at you with mucus-filled mouths. A jolt rips
through you as you remember your first meeting with the Messengers of Death and their so-
called 'bargain' with you. You now know full well that you have inadvertently uncovered enough
of their Death Letters to spell out 'Death' and now the Messengers are here to collect their
reward.

Each Messenger takes a step closer to you and points at you with a rotten finger, &quot;Death&quot; is the
only word that escapes their blackened teeth. Then each of them steps back into the shadows and
watches in silence.

Within moments you start to age incredibly rapidly: your hair turning grey, your nails growing
long and your skin wrinkling. It takes no more than a few minutes for your entire body to shrivel.
On witnessing this the Messengers disappear to whatever domain spawned them, breaking the
spell they had over you. Without the spell what's left of you collapses to the floor, nothing more
than a small, dishevelled and very old corpse.

If an expert would've at that moment examined your remains they would have come to the
conclusion that they had lain there for decades...

approaches you with renewed vigour. Turn to 231.

of silent trees and the ever-present feeling that they are looking back at you. Perhaps even now
they are uprooting themselves and heading in your direction, under the brooding clouds and over
the bodies of an army of dead just waiting below the surface.

Blink.

Yet again you shake these unusual thoughts from your head, wondering where they come from.
Whilst you are doing this you don't notice a tall figure step out from the stairs in front of you.
Raising your head with a start you are horrified to find an ancient bandaged mummy reaching
out to you. It is all you can do to cry out in shock before it has managed to grab hold of you. This
does not stop you attacking it with your chosen weapon. Your scalp crawls however when you
witness each wound inflicted upon it simply heal itself within seconds. The mummy sinks its
fingers into your neck and pulls you closer towards itself.

Outside a few birds are frightened away from their nests as terrified screams fill the air...

You are surprised to find that it isn't burned like most of the others, but that maybe because it has

distance has quite obviously moved closer. Now hell has even turned nature against you,

The whispering serenades you again and you don't know whether to feel protected or afraid.
Even your footfalls make no noise in this stretch of the house. The whispering then stops and the

The feeling of anger wells up in the room until it blocks out everything else. Billiard balls and
cues mysteriously rise up, the furniture shifts of its own accord and then the hangings billow in a
sudden breeze. After that the entire room is shook so that you and everything in it lurches over
and then back again, as if great hands had just suddenly took hold of the walls and jolted them.
Next, the image in the room shifts so that, in one instance, things are perfectly normal, and in the
next they are covered in blood.

Again the room is shook and dust and small bits of plaster fall from the ceiling. Once more the
breeze blows the hangings only now it becomes much stronger, almost a gale, so that the
furniture is entirely blown towards one wall. You find it difficult to stand up under such an
onslaught, but as you are trying to do just that you notice several billiard balls winging their way
through the air right at you. Diving to one side, you just manage to avoid them before they hit the

salvation, but you're unsure that there is any salvation in this reflected world. So there you stay,
tears brimming in your eyes as dozens of long arms come towards you seeking you out closer
and closer.

The last thing you witness in this world is a wall of hands twisting towards you...

Arriving quickly at a left-right junction you examine both possibilities. To the left the corridor
passes a southern junction and soon ends at a solidly boarded up door. To the right it passes
another southern junction and then becomes an impossibly long corridor that disappears into the
darkness of the distance. In front of you a large barred window reveals to you a veritable sea of

The Death Dragon comes crashing down as the magic infused within it, together with your
barrage of blows, at last proves too much for the ancient beast. So it just falls apart in front of
you, showering the ground with bones and sending dust into the air. When all is still you breathe
a huge sigh of relief and decide to examine the strange knife which was the cause of this near-
fatal confrontation. It's handle is made from black stone and the wavy blade seems to be steel but
you're not quite sure. The handle is decorated with screaming and weeping people, each with
their eyes covered. The steel is decorated with smiling demons.

As you place your fingers upon the knife's hilt a juddering shock is sent through you and your
mind is suddenly full of the images of creeping things in old houses, of lonely roads leading to
lakes of blood, of rains of fire, of entire cities of the dead, of blood, of torture, of pain, of hell.

You fall to the ground with your hands clasped over your head, trying your best to block out the
appalling images as the tumble through your mind and spin around you until you are left in a
vortex of terror.

Roll 1 die and add the result to your  FEAR  score.

When the awful sensation has passed you hazard a guess that by gripping the knife properly you
have just triggered its second trap.

You tuck the knife in your belt angrily hoping it will still come in handy. However, because it is
short and has the unusual blade, you must deduct 2 points from your Attack Strength if you try
to use it in a fight, unless told otherwise. So, for the moment, you decide instead to keep using
your current weapon.

Now you turn your thoughts to escape and look around the bare cave but your attention is
immediately grabbed by a hooded figure that shuffles from the darkness in front of you.
Surmising that its presence has been triggered by your destruction of the Death Dragon you are
about to defend yourself when the figure enters the moonlight and throws back its hood. A
moment of stark horror grabs you as it does.

The thing's `face' is half-eaten because it is currently writhing with maggots, as are its rotten
arms that it is extending towards you. It opens its mouth and yet more of the filthy wriggling
things issue forth and start to burrow into its chin. This display is enough to sicken the mightiest
of hearts but a further horror is revealed to you when the cadaverous thing currently staggering
towards you actually speaks. Its words are slurred and filled with agony as the thing attempts to
spit the maggots from its mouth or pull them from its empty eye sockets, but they are still clear
enough to understand: &quot;Help me.&quot; It's then that you realise that the awful thing is wearing the
same clothes you are.

Add 1   FEAR point.

You cannot stand its pitiful wails for much longer and, regardless of what it is, resolve to put an
end to its miserable life.

Unknown to you this foul creature is a Fear Demon: a being that feeds off terror itself, and the
more afraid its victim is at the time of meeting it, the more powerful it will become. You may
have met it before but, if you have done so, it was not then powerful enough to face you at that
time because your sanity would have been relatively unshaken back then. That time is past
though and this present is quite different.

The creature is now strong enough to feed off your fear directly and because of this its             SKILL
score is exactly the same as your current      FEAR score and, when you attack it, it will still defend
itself and fight you to the death despite its pleas.

If you suffer from Insectophobia, you must add 1        FEARpoint. You must also deduct 1 point from
your Attack Strength for this fight only. If it's your Primal Fear you must add 3       FEAR points. You
must also deduct 3 points from your Attack Strength for this fight. Alternatively, if you suffer


from both of these phobias and one of them is also your Primal Fear, you must turn immediately

Because there are clearly so many people in the room and since you don't know whose side
they're on yet, you opt to only open the doors a fraction, just to make sure. Your eyes widen with
fear at the nightmarish scene that grips you.

smiling guests, are three writhing men clad only in their underwear. To your utter horror, the

Once out in the centre of the lake you find yourself somewhat relieved to be away from the
horrible little island, even if it means floating above this great bottomless void. This sense of
relief is wrenched from you mere seconds later as all around you the lake begins to boil and
bubble as a gigantic shadow makes itself apparent below you. A gasp of terror escapes you as
you yank the oars into position and struggle to row away from the monstrous aberration below
you. Too late do you realise that thick rubbery tentacles are erupting out of the water both behind
and ahead of you, and then you see it, a great bulbous form lifting its humungous bulk from the
lake behind you, regarding you with two colossal eyes. Utter terror wrings you as you realise the


scale of the thing that you are now facing: far too strong to even consider fighting, your only
option is to escape.

All around you tentacles burst through the water and snake towards you, already some of which
have gripped your boat and started to violently rock it. The situation is looking grim. The great
head behind you continues to regard you as a spider does a fly, its tentacles encircling you,
gripping the boat, splintering its wood. With mounting, paralysing horror, you realise that in a
few precious seconds it will drag your boat under whilst you are still in it. Will you throw

The Cantus door opens onto a bright cheerful space full of violins, cellos and flutes, all arranged
neatly into rows or placed decoratively onto shelves around the room and each of them polished
to a shine. The thing that dominates though is a large grand piano standing on a slightly raised
platform and shining in candle light. Various chairs and cushions have been placed carefully into
a semi-circle in front of this impressive upright. Having been fooled before about such seemingly
normal areas, you scan it carefully looking for anything out of place or abnormal, but find
nothing.

There is a single unmarked door opposite you to the north.

Without warning the grand piano starts playing itself! It's soon accompanied by a few of the
strings and a silver flute. You make ready to bolt from the room but are stopped when you hear
that the music they are playing is so delicate and beautiful that you can't help but listen. After a
short time you even find yourself settling onto a comfy pillow, allowing yourself to be soothed

that you previously filled with water. You wrench the thing from your belt, undo the cord like a
madman and, just as the War Demon raises its grisly weapon, you unleash the contents of the
pouch all over your raging enemy. The suddenly freed Water Demon rushes forwards instantly,
clearly seeking the pool you took it from. All it finds though is a towering torrent of demonic
flame and steel. The results are instantaneous: a scream, a roar, a vast hissing sound, a rush of
wind and one final furious bellow as the thing in front of you falls to the ground, now nothing
more than a heap of smoking armour. As for the Water Demon; what's left of it is already

The Doom Demon is a forgotten ancient from the pit and as such it is all but invulnerable to any
type of weapon, perhaps even including the Spear of Destiny. To wit the only way for you to
destroy it is to use your Instant Death special ability and the Spear. This means that you cannot
harm it via normal combat but that you can kill it with just one extraordinarily powerful blow.

In other words, you cannot wound it at all but you can kill it outright. You may do this by rolling
a double-six when calculating your Attack Strength. It seems that hell has left you an opening
after all, albeit an extremely small one.

 6: Dysmorphophobia
 7: Insectophobia
 8: Musophobia
 9: Mysophobia
10: Phasmophobia
11: Pyrophobia
12: Toxiphobia

Every time you roll up a phobia or a Primal Fear that you already have, nothing happens .
However, each time you roll up a phobia that you didn't have before, you have it now. Whenever
you do roll up a new phobia you must Test your Fear and if Fearful must add a further            FEAR
point. If Fearless nothing will happen. If at any time you should find yourself having all 11
phobias you will be automatically frightened to death regardless of your current    FEAR  score.

You may reroll any of your rolls by Testing your Luck. If you do this and are Lucky, you may

The fog becomes thicker here and yet, to your left and straight ahead it dissipates almost entirely.
To your right it continues so that that way is swallowed entirely by the stuff, almost as if the
passageway there has been eaten. That thick patch of mist unnerves you as much as the walls, the
runes or any of the other hellish stuff surrounding you. Staring into it, scrutinising it, you set
your mind to wondering for the first time as just how Yarle's or even hell's mind works. Would
they want you to enter that thing, knowing full well that you would be devoured the moment you
did, or that the flesh would melt from your bones as soon as you'd walked into it? Perhaps it is
simply a slow-acting poison that you've already breathed and have therefore already made the
wrong choice in going anywhere near the stuff in the first place. Or, is it supposed to scare you

You head off in the direction of the statues and, the closer you get to them, the more you begin to
realise that these are no ordinary carvings. In fact, the only ordinary thing about them is the
marble they are made of, but that's where the normality ends, because each life-like statue depicts
a chained man, women or child either being sickeningly tortured or performing some horrendous
self-mutilation.

The first of these blasphemous things looms out at you from the darkness and represents a man
with his forefingers rammed up to their knuckles into his eye sockets, his mouth stretched open,
caught forever in a silent scream. The second also depicts a man, except of much smaller build.
This forsaken soul has his stomach being ripped open by three children, who then force his


trailing innards down his swollen throat; his eyes bulging so far from their sockets that blood
starts to seep from them and trickle down his horrified face. The third statue you notice is of a
painfully thin woman being torn limb from limb by a crowd of people. Her face is being ripped
from her head, leaving a trail of bloody skin hanging loosely about her neck. Her fingers are
being stretched from their sockets and some have been pulled off completely. Her tongue is in the
grip of a man and is being torn from her mouth in a spray of blood. The poor soul at the centre of
this torment already seems to have died.

You walk on through this chaos, your mouth hanging open, your stomach beginning to turn.

The next statue you pass almost proves too much for you. It is of a young boy with countless bite
marks over his body. He is being eaten alive by what must be his parents. His father has sunk his
teeth into his son's face, piercing one of his eyes and sending the remains dribbling down past the
boy's nose. This man's expression is one of excited pleasure. The mother is depicted with her
head thrown back in ecstasy, her mouth full of flesh and with blood pouring down her chin. The
child's expression is one of dumb-stuck horror, unable to move or scream.

Add 1  FEAR point.

You drag yourself on trying not to look but seeming unable to help yourself.

You approach yet another statue and see that it is of a tall man who has one of his hands rammed
up to the wrist down his throat, his fingers bursting through his neck. His other hand is ripping
the intestines from his stomach and feeding them to a crowd of dogs at his feet. You tear your
eyes from this sight and stumble on, feeling the bile start to rise in your throat.

The next to last statue you drag yourself past is of a mother and child, except that the mother is
taking no notice as her screaming baby is being strangled by a bored looking man. The final
statue you come across is of a heavily pregnant woman, but with a man bursting from her
stomach and digging his fingers into her terrified face. A crowd of delighted children rings them,
laughing, jeering and pointing.

These visions of hell make you sick, and yet it is the final statue that has you wide-eyed with
shock, because it is a perfect likeness of you. The carving is faultless in every detail and features
you standing there with your arms crossed and head thrown back, laughing manically. Confusion
engulfs you: are you seeing things, or is it all a game? Or, are you losing your mind?

With his free hand Baldly offers you a red ribbon. &quot;Blessed by no less than seven different
religions if I might make such a boast.&quot;

Handsome shakes his head, &quot;Not a boast but a fact.&quot;

Regardless of their half-logical shenanigans, you recognise the ribbon as one of the things you've
been looking for to power up the Spear and you gladly make the swap.

The Vivamus room is small and pokey but at least it has a large window that gives off the
illusion of a bit more space.

If you suffer from Claustrophobia, even if it's your Primal Fear you must add just 1    FEAR point.

It is a brightly lit space with colourful curtains, wallpaper and carpet; a mixture of greens and
pinks with flowers depicted everywhere. There is a little bed here as well as a small tin bath next
to an old fireplace and a tiny desk with an old-fashioned sewing machine upon it, currently set up
to work with the pieces of material next to it. It's only when you move closer to this 'material'
that you realise that it is human skin.

You let out a gasp in shock.

&quot;It's for the Coven,&quot; says a voice behind you.

Spinning round you see an attractive blonde woman walking into the room and closing the door
behind her. She is carrying something covered by a cloth in one of her hands. She notices you
looking at it and peers at you with her large expressive eyes then walks past to the window.

&quot;It's a nice sword that I'm just polishing up for someone.&quot; She turns from the window and
uncovers what is indeed a beautiful object. It has a golden hilt inlaid with rubies and a long silver
blade with dragons woven into the metal. &quot;If you want it you can take it,&quot; she says, holding out
the sword handle-first.

You fall to your knees, paralysed with fear, just wishing you could die. The footsteps behind you
shuffle closer, the stench becomes stronger. Then shadows are cast over you and a multitude of
inhuman sounds are heard in your ears; rotten breath is felt right on your neck.

If someone were to walk pass the mausoleum right now they would see a kneeling figure with its
hands clasping the bars of the portcullis, with its head bowed and with nothing but darkness
behind it. This someone could stand there and watch for a full three days, until the kneeling
figure would slowly slump forward and fall to the ground, where it would stay until it rots...

The stairs creak eerily as you surmount them, each one sounding different from the last; here a
pained cry, there a subtle word. The wood is black and very old. Within it are many small
defects, marks and scratches, and each one resembles something blasphemous if you look at it
from the right angle. Placed on the stairs all along its centre tongue-like is a long dark red carpet.
Above you the ceiling is painted teeth-white, giving off the impression that you're walking into a
mouth. The mirrors on either side of you beckon your attention and without wanting to you
glance at some of them.

Of course they all depict you but that doesn't stop them from lying. The first shows you with
huge gaping holes where your eyes should be, each bloody socket sending down a stream of
gore. The second shows you on fire and screaming for help, seemingly banging on the mirror
from the other side. The third shows you as a madman, covered in blood and carrying a knife and
a severed head. The forth shows you as a Demon, complete with horns, fangs and claws.

Tucking your new weapon into your belt you make a cursory search of this area, hoping against
hope to find a better means of defence. Yet all you find in the little moonlit room are yet more
rusty blades, twisted maces and warped axes. About to leave, you spy a silver glint tucked away
in a corner amongst a row of broken and splintered quarterstaffs. Intrigued, you saunter over and
find nothing more than a polished axe head free of whatever haft it had.

It has a spot of red on it.

You feel your neck muscles tighten as you are forced to look at it You feel your eyelids freeze up
as you are made to stare at it. The spot of red soon changes into a Death Letter.

The sight that greets your northward journey shocks you so much that you become rooted to the
spot in absolute disbelief. Standing in the dim light ahead of you and blocking the thin corridor
completely is the burned and half-eaten form of the Horned Demon. It is all you can do to stop
yourself sinking to your knees in despair. Then the demon, its face almost completely torn off, its
entire body black from fire, its stomach open and trailing innards, starts to limp awkwardly
towards you. It is time you stopped this thing for good.

Resolved to finish this evil once and for all, you raise your chosen weapon and advance upon it.
Luckily for you the demon is heavily wounded.

Walking past the ever changing red-white walls, occasionally glancing at some of the larger
symbols that embellish them, you see a door to your right and a passage to your left leading to a
window and then bending north, whilst the passage you've just entered continues on north itself,

Quite unbelievably, you walk right up to the edge of the lake and then start to wade into its dark
embrace. As you do so, you send ripples out into the lake and get the feeling that you are the first
thing to have disturbed its waters in a very long time; what's more, if there were anything in here
with you, waiting at the bottom, bubbling and blaspheming, then your disturbance could even
now be attracting its attention. Resolving not to think these thoughts, you wade out further into
the lake until just your head is above its surface: a little point of light in an endless, bottomless


void. You start to swim further into the lake, only now realising how cold it is, whereas even a
few moments before, your fears held the cold at bay. The black sky above is the only witness to
your movement across those waters, a little struggling figure desperately hoping not to wake any
sleeping horror from the black pit below you, a horror which even now could be sneaking
towards you, reaching out with its claws and its tentacles, opening its mouth wide, stretching
forth its tongue, about to grab you at any second, then drag you down to the depths with it.

Blink.

It's just a lake, you tell yourself, just water, there's nothing to be afraid of.

Having successfully waylaid your fears, you start to make excellent progress, even marvelling at
your own speed. You soon arrive at the little island and almost feel like offering a silent prayer.
Once safely on shore, before you even approach the gravestone you saw earlier, you notice a
battered little boat hidden in the undergrowth. The little boat even has its own oars! You marvel
at its presence and wonder how on earth it got here, having said that you are very grateful for its
appearance. Walking over to it, you give it a quick inspection and find it old but still solid and
with no apparent holes. Next, you push it out to the edge of the island, ready for a quick getaway,
just in case. Smiling to yourself, you look around and take in your meagre surroundings. Turn to

You enter this room with great care, stepping over the rats and avoiding the scorpions. Once
inside you are horrified to find the place quite literally covered in blood. Not only that, but the
bodies of several people have been torn to shreds and then the pieces have been deposited over
the floor, nailed to the walls and even hung from the ceiling.

It's like walking into a slaughterhouse.

Standing impassively amongst all of this violence and being showered with blood from the body
parts above it is a creature with no arms and a long tentacle where its head should be. As you
gaze at the demonic thing you become aware of movement under its skin and, on occasion, you
can make out the impressions of terrified faces.

About you the world shifts from light to dark from bloody to clean from fire to water and from
pleasure to pain. Your mind reels, unable to take in the constant switching between worlds and
you almost lose grip on your sanity. The thought of Yarles brings you back just in time to watch
some abhorrence born of your fears take shape in front of you in the form of a Living Phobia.

To discover what nightmarish monstrosity the demon present has brought forth from the darkest
recesses of your mind you must roll 2 dice and consult the table below.

If you do not wish to face the creature that you roll you may Test your Luck and if Lucky you
may roll on the table again. You may do this as many times as you wish,     LUCK permitting.


2: BURNING MAN                                   SKILL -                              STAMINA 8

A screaming man drenched in fire that even now is melting him comes running at you.

He will wound you for 3    STAMINA points of damage each time he hits you because of the intensity
of the heat.

If you suffer from Pyrophobia you must give him a     SKILL of 9. If it's your Primal Fear you must
give him a   SKILLof 10. If you do not suffer from Pyrophobia at all you may give him a     SKILLof
just 8.

If you defeat it read on below the table.


3: DROWNED CORPSE                                SKILL -                              STAMINA 8

A loathsome woman with pale skin dripping with filthy water steps towards you and regards you
with dead eyes.

Each time she manages to hit you twice in succession she will attempt to drown you by vomiting
a wave of polluted water at you. So, whenever she hits you twice on the trot you must Test your
Stamina and if Weak you must deduct an extra 2 points of    STAMINA


If you suffer from Aquaphobia you must give her a     SKILL of 9. If it's your Primal Fear you must
give her a  SKILL of 10. If you do not suffer from Aquaphobia at all you may give her a     SKILLof
just 8.

If you defeat it read on below the table.


4: SKULL BEAST                                   SKILL -                              STAMINA 8

A gigantic skull, as big as a horse, advances towards you on six spindly legs. From out of its
cavernous maw extend several snake-like tongues.


If you suffer from Cartilogenophobia you must give it a       SKILL of 9. If it's your Primal Fear you
must give it a  SKILL of 10. If you do not suffer from Cartilogenophobia at all you may give it a
SKILLof just 8.

You will only cause it 1   STAMINA  point of damage whenever you wound it due to its incredibly
tough bony hide.

If you defeat it read on below the table.


5: MIRROR MAN                                      SKILL -                               STAMINA 8

A strange man-like thing forms in front of you except that it isn't a man at all, because he's made
entirely from hundreds of facets of mirrored glass. Each one of these facets has a roving eye
depicted within it.

Whenever it manages to hit you all of the eyes within each of his many surfaces will all instantly
fix upon you with a terrifying baleful glare. So, whenever he hits you, you must Test your Fear
and if Fearful you must add 1   FEARpoint.

If you suffer from Catoptrophobia you must give him a         SKILL of 9. If it's your Primal Fear you
must give him a   SKILLof 10. If you do not suffer from Catoptrophobia at all you may give him a
SKILLof just 8.

If you defeat it read on below the table.


6: LIVING ROOM                                      SKILL -                              STAMINA 8

The room itself twists and turns until at last it starts to close in upon you. Furthermore the walls
have now started to open up revealing large toothed mouths.

Each time the 'room' hits you it will attempt to crush you. To wit: whenever you are hit you must
Test your Stamina and if Weak you must deduct an extra point of       STAMINA  .

If you suffer from Claustrophobia you must give it a      SKILLof 9. If it's your Primal Fear you must
give it a SKILL of 10. If you do not suffer from Claustrophobia at all you may give it a       SKILLof
just 8.

If you defeat it read on below the table.


7: EVERYMAN                                          SKILL -                             STAMINA 8

A repellent figure forms in front of you. It writhes and squirms as it hobbles towards you. This is
because it has too many legs for its frame. That's because it's at least three people all joined
together in some horrific experiment, then driven mad by it until they are just a staggering mass
of biting mouths, kicking feet and punching fists.

Each time you are hit by this mutant thing Test your Skill and if Unskilful you must deduct an
extra point of STAMINA as it gets another lesser attack in with one of its many deformed limbs.

If you suffer from Dysmorphophobia you must give it a         SKILL of 9. If it's your Primal Fear you
must give it a  SKILL of 10. If you do not suffer from Dysmorphophobia at all you may give it a

8: SWARMING ZOMBIE                                  SKILL -                           STAMINA 8

A repulsive undead steps towards you on rotten feet. It grabs for you with a broken arm and
looks at you with half its face missing. What's more the disgusting thing is absolutely surrounded
by a swarm of buzzing mosquitoes.

At the start of each round you must automatically lose 1 point of      STAMINA because of the many
insects now sucking your blood.


If you suffer from Insectophobia you must give it a    SKILLof 9. If it's your Primal Fear you must
give it aSKILL  of 10. If you do not suffer from Insectophobia at all you may give it a SKILLof just
8.

If you defeat it read on below the table.


9: RAT DEMON                                        SKILL -                           STAMINA 8

A sickening sight is suddenly offered to you as a swarm of rats rears up in front of you to form a
living, walking 'man'.

Each time you hit it you must Test your Skill and if Unskilful you will have missed the rats
entirely as the complete mass expertly bends away from your blow. In this case you will fail to
cause it any damage in that round.

If you suffer from Musophobia you must give it a      SKILL of 9. If it's your Primal Fear you must
give it aSKILL of 10. If you do not suffer from Musophobia at all you may give it a  SKILLof just 8.

If you defeat it read on below the table.


10: LEPER                                           SKILL -                           STAMINA 8

A monstrous man limps towards you. He's limping because most of one of his legs has rotted
away, as has most of his face and one of his arms. He's definitely still a man though, not an
undead because he pleads with you to kill him before he suddenly attacks. You can't stand the
thought of this diseased thing laying its rotten fingers anywhere near you but you have little
choice but to fight him.

Test your Luck after this fight and if Unlucky, lose a     SKILL point due to now being partially
afflicted by some terrible wasting disease.

If you suffer from Mysophobia you must give him a      SKILLof 9. If it's your Primal Fear you must
give him a   SKILLof 10. If you do not suffer from Mysophobia at all you may give him a     SKILL of
just 8.

If you defeat it read on below the table.


11: THE HAUNTED                                     SKILL -                           STAMINA 8

A woman with no pupils or irises walks towards you with arms outstretched. Dressed in funeral
garb she brings the musty smell of death with her. To add to this are a group of swirling,
screaming moaning spirits which circle her constantly.

Each time she hits you, you must Test your Fear and if Fearful you must deduct a      LUCK point due
to the spirits cursing you.


If you suffer from Phasmophobia you must give her a        SKILL  of 9. If it's your Primal Fear you
must give her a    SKILLof 10. If you do not suffer from Phasmophobia at all you may give her a
SKILL of just 8.

If you defeat it read on below the table.


12: BLOATED CORPSE                                 SKILL -                              STAMINA 8

A truly revolting bloated corpse trundles towards you on its great fat puss-covered legs. As it
does so you see that several snakes are swarming over it and biting it even as it homes in on you.
Then without further warning this hideous poison-infested thing attacks you.

Each time it hits you, you must deduct 1 initial    STAMINA  point as well as the usual 2 points of
STAMINA  damage. This is due to the awful poison that you will be subjected to.

If you suffer from Toxiphobia you must give it a   SKILLof 9. If it's your Primal Fear you must give
it aSKILL of 10. If you do not suffer from Toxiphobia at all you may give it a   SKILLof just 8.

If you defeat it read on below.


Once you've despatched the abominable thing sent from your mind to attack you, you break free
of the swirling shifting world and snap back to reality.

The thing in front of you seems to notice this and instantly appears to 'wake up'. As soon as it has
done so it starts to stagger through the blood towards you with an otherworldly gait. The minute
it does a multitude of mouths burst through its skin all over its body and begin to open and shut
endlessly.

The door behind you slams shut and jams itself in the frame.

You most certainly have no wish to face such an alien creature but you have little choice.

This creature you now face is a Chaos Demon, a being that lives both in the real world and the
realm of chaos, dipping in and out almost constantly, bending the laws of physics as it does so.

To demonstrate this you must, every time you win an attack round, note the number that you've
just rolled:

If the number was even you have failed to wound it at all.
If the number was odd you have caused it 1 point of damage.
If the number was a double you have wounded it in the normal way.

CHAOS DEMON                                      SKILL 7                                STAMINA 7

The old servant looks utterly shocked. 'W-we are d-done for.' With those words he bolts off back
to his room and you hear heavy furniture being dragged and pushed against its door. The moans
of the dead serenade you and their filthy smell gets even stronger. Then you see them as they
stagger and crawl out of the shadows to your left, leaving trails of blood and slime. A flicker of
movement to your north catches your attention and you notice the ancient bandaged horror
striding towards you shoulder to shoulder with the Horned Demon.

Dumbfounded with shock and frozen to the core with fear you can only wonder which fate will
befall you first. Your horrified question is soon answered as the door behind you is suddenly
ripped off its hinges and a tremendous heat rushes out at you. A single breath later and some sort
of huge shaggy beast launches itself at you with a roar that shakes the house, lifts you up off the
ground with one giant clawed hand and then rams you face-first down into its mouth. The last
thing you see before the incisors enclose around your head is that even the mummy and the

Walking to the right, mind occupied by the weirdly changing walls and their unknowable
symbols, you fail to notice yourself walking into an even thicker patch of fog. Which is strange
because there is a nest of illuminated skulls just above you, dripping wax from their lighted
cranial candles. Knitting your brows in confusion you prepare to turn back when a scream from
the unnatural haze ahead chills you to the bone.

From our of the sickly yellowness in front of you lurches a woman. At first glance you take her
to have her hands clasped against the sides of her face. At second glance you understand that
they are growing there. The fingers melded to the head from birth, the arms permanently locked
to each side. This horrible mutation has forced her head to face upwards at all times. Her mouth
is stretched wide, locked into an endless scream. A look into her pure wide white eyes leads you
to believe that she has long since lost her sanity. As the woman reels towards you, she lets out
another scream that hurts your ears.

Unknown to you this creature is a tortured undead spirit, locked in its own endless nightmare,
seeing things that only it can see. The only way for these lost souls to escape is to trap another
within their nightmare instead, and then they'll be free. You step back and almost bump into
something but then, amazingly, you walk straight through it.

Looking down you realise it's your own sleeping body.

The spirit has trapped you within its nightmare and you must fight the hideous screaming
apparition as it tries to bite your throat out. Luckily you still have a 'ghost' version of your chosen
weapon to defend yourself with. However, you're in its realm now and must abide by its rules.

To discover its   SKILL  score you must roll two dice eleven times and consult the Phobia Table
below on each of these occasions. Each time you roll one of your normal phobias you must add 1
point to itsSKILL . Each time you roll your Primal Fear you must add 2 points to its    SKILL .

However, if you suffer from Dysmorphophobia or Phasmophobia you must roll an extra time for
each or either of them on the table below, bringing your total roll count up to twelve or thirteen
times; but, if one of them is your Primal Fear, you must roll an extra of three times for that one
on the table below, bringing your total roll count up to as fourteen or fifteen.


You may reroll any of your rolls by Testing your Luck. If you do this and are Lucky, you may
ignore the previous roll on the phobia table and attempt it again. You may do this as many times
as you have  LUCK  points available.

Ripping the flare from your pocket, you take aim at one of the great eyes bearing down upon
you. The moment you set the flare off it streaks in a blaze right at the creature's eye causing it to
recoil in a flash and sink below the surface as fast as it can, taking its wounded eye as far away
from you as possible.

Add 1  LUCK  point, but of course you now no longer have any flares.

Regardless of this fact, you waste no time in rowing like a madman back to the shore, despite the

Against your better judgement you approach the eerie painting and are instantly struck dumb by
the fact that the person in the picture is quite clearly you! Even down to the clothes you wear and
the style of your hair. This person then, this 'you', is shown almost as if it were bursting from the
canvas. This is not surprising considering that its expression is one of wide-eyed horror as if
something truly awful had happened.

There is a creak behind you, a shocking blow to the skull, and the world goes black.

You awake and instantly start screaming as you become conscious of the fact that you are now
trapped within the painting and staring at your soulless own body gazing blankly back at you. A
slam is heard as the gallery door is opened wide and a repulsive smiling creature with a head
shaped like a lump of raw meat comes loping over to your inert body. The smiling creature turns
its misshapen eyeless head in your direction and stands motionless for a moment smiling all the
while. Then you are horror-stricken to watch it start to eat your body...

Walking along it, aware of the vague cries of the dead and the subtle smell of burning, you come

You force yourself to ignore the roars and walk on through the darkness towards them, your legs
shaking as you do so. The tunnel bends sharply ahead of you and the sound of rasping breathing
can soon be heard from around the corner. You take a deep breath and prepare to defend yourself
against whatever godless creature you must now face.

You step round the corner and instantly notice a small fury cabbage-sized creature cowering in
front of you at the entrance to a lighted cave. It shakes on the floor in front of you and stares at
you with frightened eyes. This creature has long feet and an enormous toothless mouth that
seems to make up most of the rest of its body. Surely this funny little thing can not be the source
of the earth-shaking noises that you have been hearing? As if in answer to this, the little creature
opens its mouth and lets out the loudest bellow you have ever known. It then runs past you and
off into the darkness. You shake your head in wonder and a relieved smile splits your face.

Deduct 1  FEAR point and add 1 LUCK  point.

You walk on into the cave.


The moment you enter your nostrils are assailed by a vibrant but not unpleasant cocktail of
alcoholic smells as you notice yourself arriving in what can only be the wine cellar. Vast barrels
line one wall and the other three are stacked ceiling-high with hundreds of dusty bottles, some of
which are so thickly coated with the stuff that you can't even tell what colour the glass used to
be, let alone what on earth was once written on the label.

It's at this time that you suddenly notice a little bald man sitting on a stool in one dark corner. He
has large spectacles and a bushy white beard. He smiles at you. &quot;Impressive collection isn't it?&quot;
he asks with a chuckle. He sees you eyeing him suspiciously and shrugs his shoulders as a sort of
response. &quot;I know you're not one of them because you'd have at least shouted or threatened me
by now. The fact that you haven't suggests you're on my side. In that case I'd like to offer you
some help.&quot; He indicates the floor, &quot;please, sit down. I'd offer you my stool but I am rather old.&quot;

You walk carefully over to the car, vaguely aware of some slight movement in the shadows by
the trees. Once at the car you peer in and notice that it seems empty of coffins, which strangely
relieves you. Grabbing hold of the door handle and breathing deeply, you gradually open the
door, wincing at the small creaking sound it sends into the light. Within moments you regret your
actions as a wash of blood floods from the car and drenches your shoes. Wide-eyed and with
your hand over your mouth, you back away in horror and quickly go to the steel door behind
you. Add 1     FEARpoint and turn to 197.

With some trepidation and painfully aware of how quiet your surroundings are, you approach a
few of the tombs and gingerly investigate their contents. At first you are both disappointed and
afraid, for all you find are old bones and rotten clothes. Moments later though, in a small yet
ornate coffin, hidden in shadows and covered in spider webs, you find, amongst the bones, a tiny
silver whistle! You wonder what on earth such a thing is doing here: a handyman's way of
calling his dogs? Or a lost hiker's way of attracting attention? Shuddering slightly, you still find
yourself hoping the whistle could prove useful. Now turn to 153 to consider your next move.

In a moment of stark horror, the full realisation of what is about to happen becomes apparent.
Fear consumes and breaks your mind as the thing's tentacles began to drag the boat under, with
you still in it. Then, as it begins to submerge the boat completely, a cold rubbery tentacle snakes
around your waist and prepares to sink back down with you in its grasp, into darkness and
oblivion. You do not cry out. You do not move. Your sanity has shattered and you do nothing as
it hauls you under.

You walk down the northern path with the utmost caution, hugging the shadows and slipping
from tree to tree, eyes wide for any movement, ears pricked for the slightest sound. Suffice to say
all of the people and the zombies really do seem to have gone. You stand in the shadows and
look slowly about you. The trees look back at you. You hear them breath; their hearts beating,
their mouths opening.

Blink.

Suddenly, you get the feeling that you are actually safer in the middle of the path than near any
of the warped things that flank it. On you walk, steadily, cautiously, down the curving trail, the
moon shining above you, a gentle wind in your face, a slight smell of blood in the air. At last,
after a tight curve, a mansion appears at the end of this path. You stop and stare at the great
hulking thing as it crouches in the distance, brooding, waiting.

It's looking at me.

You shake your head but can't ignore the feeling that the great gloomy lump squatting ahead of
you is actually staring at you, examining you, testing you, searching your mind and judging your
worth. This feeling is far from pleasant but the more you look at it the more you get the sinking
feeling that the entire structure could uproot itself right now and shake the ground as it lumbers
towards you. This great dark thing, this mouth of chaos waiting at the centre of everything, fully
aware that all strands, all cords, all links of humanity, all lead here and will all end here. This
watchful eye resting at the apex of all things, ever waiting, never sleeping, opening wide, looking
at the world.

Blink.

You raise your hands to your face and wrench your head away from the mansion.

It's nothing, nothing.

You suddenly walk onwards, your fists balled at your sides and grim determination adorning
your face. You will meet this thing, alone if necessary and head-on if required. nothing will sway
you from this task. Onwards you walk, the mansion looming over you, every window barred,
until you are close enough to see a closed and padlocked cellar partially hidden in the shadows,
the front door next to it and, to your surprise, two massive statues planted to either side of it.

Two huge statues flank the door each resembling a giant robed, hooded man with a vast axe
clasped in his right hand, the head of which is driven partially into the ground, giving off the
impression of a pair of warrior monks. As for the left arms of these titanic twins, they are each
stretched out in front of them with the hand carved so that all of their fingers point skyward and
the palms are clearly showing. They almost look as if they are holding something back. As your
eyes adjust to the darkness you notice that the hoods of the figures have been carved so that they
cover their faces completely. This new discovery changes how they look to you; not so much as
monks but as executioners.

You give a slight shudder but still can't help but admire how large the statues are. In fact are still
so taken aback by the physical size of the things that it takes you some time to notice a raggedly
dressed figure standing between them. You squint and try to make it out more clearly but it is
difficult because the creature is surrounded in shadows. Your eyes soon adjust though and then
they widen in shock. The creature has a rotting ram's head growing out of each of its shoulders!
You feel fear well up inside of you because you now recognise the thing in front of you: a
Horned Demon. An immensely powerful foe, far too dangerous to meet in combat and, even if
you could sum up the courage to do so you are not sure even sure that you would be able to harm
it in the first place. You must look for another way into the House.

You may either walk to the left, turn to 144. Or the right, turn to 391.

The little winding tunnel guides you snake-like into a largish poorly-lit cave featuring a door to
the right and something big and rectangular at its furthest shadowy point. Peering through the
darkness, you can just about make out a small single candle resting atop the structure and also
that there is subtle movement all over it.

If you wish to investigate it, turn to 433.
If you'd rather walk onwards to the right-hand door, turn to 17.

                                                  235
You step down onto some time-worn steps and notice that they seem far older than the rest of the
House and conclude that they must have been here long before it was built. You peer into the
shadowy confines of the cellar and quickly notice that there is a single flickering bulb hanging
from the ceiling at its far end. It is by this light source that you determine that the steps you are
on descend some way before you and then lead into a tunnel with several doors set in it. You
walk down them and feel somewhat ill at ease at the smallness and distance of the single point of
light that illuminates your surroundings. Indeed, it casts great flickering shadows all about you
and gives off the impression that there is movement everywhere you look.

You pull out your first map featuring the grounds of the House and decide to add the cellar onto
it.

You stop dead.

There is movement here, but not from all around you, rather it is from dead ahead and emanates
from what you had at first assumed to be a large pocket of shadow on the floor. However, your
heart leaps into your throat when this shadow rears up before you and blocks the tunnel ahead
with its hulking, misshapen form. Worse still there is a resounding crash behind you as the cellar
doors have just been slammed shut.

You have a feeling that you have just stepped into a trap.

You turn your attention back to the thing in front of you and notice with a sinking feeling in your
stomach that it has now begun to advance awkwardly towards you. It is vaguely humanoid in
form, seeing as it has two arms, two legs and a single head, yet there is still something incredibly
unnatural about its appearance and this is only accentuated by the erratic way in which it
stumbles towards you. As the thing comes closer and you can make it out more clearly you
notice that its fingers are all broken and that its head is far too large for its body. Not only this
but something in the way that the monstrosity lurches towards you gives it an aspect of a thing
that is totally inhuman, that was not meant to ever exist in this world let alone be seen by anyone
sane.

It takes one more clumsy step towards you and at last, even in this gloom, the creature is now
plain to see, but what you see almost makes your heart stop. The thing's skin is black in colour,
riddled with many notches and scars and hangs in great loose folds about its deformed frame. Its
arms and legs are not jointed correctly and this gives it its horrible way of moving. On the ends
of its bony fingers sit yellowed and broken nails. Its head is so big that its neck cannot properly
support it and so the hideous twisted lump leans permanently to one side. Then, in one stark
moment of horror, you take in its face as it towers above you: it looks like it has melted.

Moreover, its nose is merely a blackened hole, its mouth is stretched so wide that its lower jaw
hangs down to below its neck. What's more, both of its eyes have burst and dribbled down to its
broken, blackened teeth.

Add 1   FEAR point.

However, the more you gaze at this appalling creature the more an even deeper horror begins to
well up within you for you cannot help but think that this creature is not a demon or an
unfortunate member of the undead. In fact, despite its physical shape and the manner of its


movement you cannot help but notice that there is still something very familiar about it as a
whole, something that tugs at the back of your mind until, at last, it dawns on you: the creature
you now face is human.

This realisation hits you like a thunderbolt and makes the thing you must now meet in combat
somehow more terrifying and more revolting than any demon or zombie.

Add another   FEAR point.

The horrible thing staggers towards you and makes ready to grasp you with its spindly fingers,
forcing you to ignore your terror and face it.

If you suffer from Dysmorphophobia you must deduct 1 from your Attack Strength for this fight.
You must also add 1     FEAR  point. However, if it is your Primal Fear, you must deduct 3 points
from your Attack Strength for this fight instead. You must also add 3    FEAR points instead.

The very thought of this awful creature actually touching you fills you with such a sickening
revulsion that, each time it hits you and regardless of any phobias you may or may not have, it

succeeded in laying its clammy hands on you.

Your walk through the woods around the lake is utterly silent, still giving you the impression that
the trees are listening. You do your best to filter out such thoughts and concentrate on just
finding a boat. On you walk, through the silence, keeping one eye on the mirror-smooth lake to
your right. As you walk through the trees you glimpse the moon above you and note its feeble
attempts to send any light down to the forest floor, almost as if the trees were forcing it back.
Ignoring this feeling you walk on through the somewhat skeletal trees, more than a few of which
are dead or diseased, creating the impression that you are walking through a graveyard.

A short while later, through shadows and silence, you at last come across a small boat complete
with oars. The little vessel is resting against the bank and tethered to an old tree. Just then, out of
the corner of your eye, you catch a blisteringly fast movement, just as hooded figure rushes at
you from out of the darkness: the guardian of the boat? You have little time to wonder as you
throw yourself to one side just as the figure wheels about and rushes at you again, its cloak
billowing wildly behind it. You leap to your feet and catch a look at your would be attacker as it
closes in on you: it is skeletally thin and, your heart leaps to your throat, its flesh is rotten! The
thing attacks you with its bare, clawed hands and, as you struggle with it, you do your best not to
look at its sickening face, let alone take in its putrid breath. An instant later and the thing has
engaged you in combat, desperately trying to grasp your throat and bite your face.

This creature is a Wight, an undead fiend whose deathly cold touch is so utterly chilling that it
can easily cause frostbite: if it manages to wound you three or more times during this fight you

You swiftly realise that the pouch is now useless to you and must instead face this creature in
combat. Deduct 1    LUCK point.

This being is composed purely of magical armour and flame so it will be very difficult to do it
any real damage. To demonstrate this you must, each time you win an Attack Round, roll a die
and consult the result. If the number rolled is 1-3 you have wounded it in the normal way. If the
result is 4-6 then your blow has failed to do it any harm and will not have caused it any damage.

If you suffer from Pyrophobia, you must deduct 1 from your Attack Strength for the duration of
this fight. You must also add a   FEAR  point if you haven't already. However, if it is your Primal
Fear, you must instead deduct 3 points from your Attack Strength for this encounter. You must

Feeling very odd, you carefully examine the life-like statue, feeling for all the world as though it
could spring at you at any moment, wrecking the night with its laughter, lifting you off the
ground with its stone hands, turning its face towards you, mouth opening wide.

Blink.

Shaking your head, you clear the vision from your mind and suddenly become aware of a string
of rosary beads, minus the crucifix, around the statue's neck. Peering closer you find that they
haven't been placed around its neck so much as twisted around it in mock strangulation. You
untie the beads with slightly shaking fingers, wondering at who put them there and why? They
could of course be a sick joke. After all, you've always assumed hell to have a sense of humour.

The moment you set foot into the House proper there is absolute silence. It's as if it's been
waiting for you.

And only you.

You stand there for a short while cocooned in stillness, as though the walls were holding their
breath and the shadows were trying not to move. You close your eyes a few moments and then
look around.

Beneath your feet is a luxurious thick red carpet. The walls are decorated in expensive looking
green wallpaper, decorated with many lilies. Above you the ceiling is white and painted with a
pleasing swirl effect. At various points along it are what must be very costly if small and rather
delicate chandeliers. These give off a few pools of light to illuminate the otherwise rather dark
interior.

You are standing at a t-junction. To your left a short corridor soon turns further into the house,
past one room. To your right, the corridor continues for a longer distance, past one room then
turning forwards at another. To your front it goes between the two closest rooms and then meets
another corridor.

You look at the map you've been making so far. Turning the sheet over you decide to start a
fresh map of this floor of the House on the other side.


Then you hear something, a barely audible whispering coming from, where? The walls? The
rooms? Your mind? Whatever it is it almost seems to float towards you down each passageway

Cursing your forgetfulness, you realise that you've already tried this door earlier and you
accidentally let out a snarl of anger. As the echo of your outburst fades away you soon become
aware of the scrape of a key in a lock and the grind of stone as a door is thrown open. You lash
out as voices and laughter reverberate around you but you simply cannot hope to fight blind, let
alone against two or three foes. Rough hands grab you and you are quickly disarmed and then
wrenched along the tunnel and into another room by the sounds of things. Presently you are
thrown bodily onto a table and, judging by the feel of things, chained here. Now the laughing
voices disappear and a slam of a door is heard. Quiet footsteps pad towards you and a gleeful
voice can be heard in your ear, 'A pity you won't see what I'm about to do to you because I
normally leaves the eyes till last. Still, at least you'll be able to feel.' The air is now filled with
metallic sounds and the spluttering of a torch. 'Forgive me,' says the sneering voice, 'but I always
like to take my time to prepare these things, and we have a long, long night ahead of us.'

Tears stream down your face as you realise the magnitude of what's about to happen to you...

The whispering increases, as does the sound of scraping stone, but you dare not turn round
because you know that if there were something there your heart would stop. Instead you sink to
the floor and close your eyes, even as you hear the squelch of rotten feet approach your exposed
back and as the stench of putrid flesh fills your nostrils.

Fumbling and stumbling you make your way up the tunnel until your foot hits some stone steps.
Thankfully you seem to have avoided the blasphemous body of the Abomination. So now you
must be at the entrance of the cellar. You can only hope that the mummy has gone.

Slowly, you make your way up the old pock-marked steps and push at the broken cellar doors,
which in their current state simply fall in on themselves and crash to the floor. Tensing, you


await on the steps, listening for any kind of danger, but nothing seems to happen. Climbing the
last of the steps you soon feel the open air again and must now decide how you will try to re-
enter the House. If you want to grope your way around to the front door, turn to 457. If you want

The House holds its breath as you step onto the top floor scarcely believing you've made it this
far, whispering to itself in the shadows, its walls regarding you with interest, rooms shrinking
back from you in wonderment, ceiling pulling up from you in disbelief.

Blink.

The carpet up here is black and course like animal fur. The walls are alternately white or red
depending on how you look at them, and each one is covered in strange twisted runes that you
don't understand. The ceiling looks like ancient rock and even has stalagmites coming down
from it. It too is covered in the unfathomable symbols. Now and again, here and there, are grisly
chandeliers, except that they are now comprised of old skulls with dribbling candles on them. All
of the doors look scorched and each of them is riddled with the odd symbols once again.

Standing stock still, the only sounds that come to you are the muffled cries of the dead and the
distant crackle of flames. You decide to move on. Ahead of you is an impossibly long
passageway that surely too big to fit in the House. It is criss-crossed with other corridors and
passes a number of rooms. To your left the passage leads to a door and then turns forward. To
your right the passage ends at similar door and then also turns forward.

You pull out another sheet of paper from your other back pocket and decide to start your final

Ignoring the black ooze, assuming it to be something just dribbling down from the room above,
you make your way to each of the paintings. At first, you make them out to be just as your first
glance told you, just ordinary depictions of ordinary things: woods, rivers, plains and so forth.
It's only when you gaze closer at them that you start to make out a series of small terrified faces.
Each of them is just that, a face. Some of them appear in the windows of farms, others in ponds
or lakes, some in trees and some in fields, yet each of them looks scared to the point of death:
screaming their endless screams, crying, pleading, begging for help that cannot come. It is
somewhat disturbing for you then, to discover that one of the faces looks exactly like you.

Walking through the screams, muscles tense in case anything should leap out at you. The only
thing you really come across though is a small mirror. It's been stuck into the ground next to a
woman at just the right angle so that when the sun rises it will focus its rays and burn her face.
She already has several scorch marks where this has happened. You resolve to take the mirror
with you and at least spare the poor soul a portion of torment. After all, these people, like most of

You burst into your chosen room and slam the door behind you. Then you jerk a sofa in front of
it and hide behind a desk in the corner. The door is only made of wood though and the mummy
smashes its way through with ease, lifting and throwing the sofa out of its way as it does so. The
ragged thing then slowly advances upon you, uncannily finding you as though it could sense you
by your mere presence. The ancient musty smell grows stronger as the hideous bandaged thing
reaches out and splits the desk in two. Now it reaches down for you with cracked fingers and
dirty elongated nails. Luckily for you, you have already died of a heart attack ...

The phone seems to be gold-plated and you find yourself having half a mind to steal it! Quickly,
you scold yourself for such thoughts, even in this House of horror. Picking up the receiver,
hoping for a dialling tone so you can call for help, as if anyone would believe you, you place the
earpiece close to you. At first all you can hear is static and white noise. Then, quietly at first, you
can hear the echoes of wails and the sounds of people crying. After this a voice speaks directly
into the phone and screams you the following message: 'Don't believe anything in this House!
It's all a giant puzzle, designed to fool you and kill you and put you here with us!&quot; Then the
phone goes dead and you place it back on its hook with a look of dread on your face.

Gingerly, you start to rummage through the mountain of bleached white bones, grimacing at the
cold touch of all the jaws, teeth and rib cages surrounding you. It feels like you are disturbing the
dead and, as you carefully lift and move each finger bone, spine and skull, trying to find
something of interest, you keep getting the feeling that you are doing something shameful.

After a few more minutes of searching you realise that the pile of bones is deeper than you
thought and that the cupboard actually goes back some way. To make a thorough search of this
cupboard you are going to have to climb inside of it, the thought of which makes the skin on

Unfortunately you are also looking at a giant man that looks like he's been sewn together using
the mismatching body parts of at least other three people. He has one large lopsided head with
different coloured eyes, huge shoulders, one muscled arm and one thin one. He has one normal
leg but his other has been split at the base and each stump has a foot of its own, giving the

another head with roving eyes.

From this eerie flickering light you can make out dozens of corpses. Some of them have been

or look like they've been partially eaten. At least one or two of them look like they've been

You walk right up to the edge of the lake, untether the boat and take it out into the dark embrace
of the waters. As you do so, you send out ripples across the lake and get the feeling that you are
the first thing to have done so for decades; what's more, if there were anything in here with you,
waiting at the bottom, bubbling and blaspheming, then your disturbance could even now be
attracting its attention.

Resolving not to think these thoughts, you row out further into the lake until you are at its centre:
a little point of light in an endless, bottomless void. You start to head further into the lake, the
black sky above the only witness to your movement across those waters, a little struggling figure
desperately hoping not to wake any sleeping horror from the black pit below, a horror which
even now could be sneaking towards you, reaching out with its claws and its tentacles, opening
its mouth wide, stretching forth its tongue, about to grab you at any second, then drag you down

Blink.

It's just a lake, you tell yourself, just water, there's nothing to be afraid of.

that its nails carry a poison within them and should it hit you four times you will become

acknowledge that it must be some type of magical substance. This is because you can clearly see
yourself: your arms, legs, hands and so on, but you can see absolutely nothing else. It's as if for

to this unnatural feeling is that you can now hear a faint whispering all around you, similar to
that which you've heard earlier in the House.

You strain your ears but just can't make out what the voices are saying. For all you know they

With great caution you slowly open the door, nerves taught, muscles tense. Nothing seems to
leap out at you though and nothing seems to happen as you creep into the room either. So, one
arm in front of you, the other cradling your chosen weapon, you advance carefully into the room.
After a few steps you trip over something and send your weapon clattering noisily across the
floor. Cursing your ill fortune you start to try and find it when you bump into something else and
wince at the clatter of steel as what sound like several weapons hit the floor about you.

You must be back in the armoury.

Shrugging your shoulders you reach out for the nearest weapon and find what seems to be some
sort of quarterstaff with one end broken off. Still, it is quite long and could form a makeshift
means of defence in a pinch. What's more you can't help noticing that the number '7' appears to
have been ingrained along one side of it.

You decide to keep it because in your current situation you may need something with a bit of
reach to it and you don't fancy fumbling around in here for any longer than you have to.

In combat using the broken quarterstaff will allow you to fight with just one point deducted from
your Attack Strength.

You leave the room. Now you return to the front door, place your back against it to get your

Padding along the soft carpet to the left you soon come across the far northern exit. It leads to a
dark little option that soon turns to the right. Feeling you have little choice but to follow it, you
do just that. Before you can though you spy movement through a window and see someone
standing in the middle distance. There is subtle movement around him in the shadows but you're
too far away to identify what it is.

The figure waves at you to get your attention and when it's satisfied that it has it, it beckons to
you. You don't know what to do with this heavily barred window between you so you point at it
and shake your head. On seeing this the figure in the darkness seems to burst out laughing. With
this action the movement around him closes in and as far as you can make out from this distance,
he is literally torn apart.

Suppressing the urge to be sick, you move onwards and then round the corner to the right and
find a door leading to a moonlit room with another metal door to its right. Upon closing the door
you entered by you observe that it sits perfectly flush against the wall and that there is no handle
this side so that there doesn't appear to be a door there at all. You turn around and examine this
new area.

You are delighted to find that this room is brimming with weapons of all kinds: obviously an
armoury. At first you are elated at the thought of finally getting your hands on a real means of
self defence. Your hopes are somewhat dashed then when your eyes adjust to the gloom and you
become conscious of the fact that each and every weapon here is either broken or rusty beyond
belief. At first you find it difficult to comprehend that every sword adoring the walls, every axe
leaning in a corner and every mace, quarterstaff, dagger and polearm presented in front of you, is
in truly horrible condition.

Letting forth a sigh and stepping further amongst the various tools of war, the candle behind you
casting odd shadows, you decide which thing to take with you. In spite of everything, even this
sorry collection is better than what you have. After a few minutes examining the poor quality
goods on offer you make out that three of them that are in less awful condition than the others.

They are: a blunt sword, an old axe and a very rusty mace.

Decide which one you wish to take and leave your old weapon here. Regardless, you feel better
for having a 'proper' weapon within your grasp at last.

Deduct 1   FEAR  point.

These weapons are better than what you had but are far from perfect. For this reason, when you
use them in combat, you must deduct only 1 point from your Attack Strength.

The moment the Plague Demon falls, the rats that were infesting it suddenly stop their attack and
begin to wander the kitchen warily, taking little notice of you anymore. You ignore the rats, and

You sink to the floor and, despite the abject terror you are feeling, start to concentrate, holding
any holy items you may have to your heart. With great strength, you feel a small surge of power
within your stomach and then force that power to rush through you until it is all you can feel.
Then you snap out of your Zen-like trance and notice that there are no more sounds and no more
footsteps. Cautiously, you turn your head and survey the empty crypt behind you.

All is still.

A great flood of relief flows through you and you get to your feet, frightened but alive and
unharmed. Nonetheless, you are still stuck in here and your claustrophobia is still gnawing at the

The moment you do, you hear a sudden commotion behind you, causing you to instantly hunch
your shoulders and whip your head round. Hands are coming up through the earth all around
you. A stench of blood fills the air as dozens of rotten corpses extract themselves from the
ground, filling the air with pitiful moans. There are too many to fight and to many to run
through. What's more the lock is so rusted that it will take time to open it, time you certainly
don't have. Then you see it, the oil on the ground coming from the old hearse. If you could light

Back on the moonlit trail, surrounded by trees and shadows and serenaded by a gentle breeze,
you again get a feeling of wrongness, like you are being watched from every direction.
Swallowing the feeling, you look around yourself and take your bearings. It seems you have
several choices of direction. You should choose an option you have not chosen before:

Just to your north and back up the trail a little bit and overlooking it, is a tiny darkened house
that you assume must belong to the groundkeeper. If you wish to investigate it, turn to 289, if

already.


Turning your head to the north-east you notice a thin path making its way to a glistening lake. If

To your north-west and off the main path you can make out the white dome of what you assume
to be the family's mausoleum. If you feel like a closer look, turn to 355, if you have not done so
already.

To your west is a trail that leads to what seems to be a statue-filled garden. Turn to 195, to go
there if you wish to and have not done so already.

undead have finally broken into the House as you'd expected. You turn around and realise that

smoke escaping afterwards, leading you to believe that the fire has now practically engulfed the

The towering monstrosity comes crashing down, shaking the entire roof as it does so. It tries to
raise its 'head' but the power of the Spear cannot be denied and the 'head' falls back down again
and the entire mass stops moving.

The Doom Demon is dead.

At that moment a massive smashing noise resounds next to the side of the House and you rush
over to find out what it is, dodging any smoke or flame as you do so. Once you get there and
look over the side your jaw drops at what you see. Down below you and 'staring' up at you with
its window-eyes is the large square white form of the grounds man's house! It seems to take you
in with those square portals and could almost be smiling at you with its door 'mouth'. From out of
its side walls extend huge brick 'arms' and it has evidently dragged itself to the House during the
course of your battle.

As you watch the small white house a weird mist escapes it and enters the main house proper.
You assume that you have just encountered the Presence. A moaning noise catches your
attention and you look beyond the white house to see a positive sea of the dead all converging on
the main House. Some are already here and are even now banging on the walls or smashing the
windows in an attempt to enter. Behind you part of the House collapses into flame. Ahead of you
the circle of trees has approached even further and is now nothing more than a raging inferno.

There is of course no escape.

A sudden shudder shakes the entire House and causes further sections of the roof to fall in to
flame, doubtless crushing some of the moaning dead that were already searching for you. That
gives you some grim satisfaction. The House shudders again and all of its windows break and the
iron bars upon them buckle. You almost lose your balance when the House actually shifts its
entire bulk. Behind you a vast section of the roof has fallen in and just above it to its left and
right two large sections have also fallen. Then you realise what has happened: the Presence has
just took over the entire House and you are now looking at its new face!

At that moment it starts to collapse in on itself and you are consoled with what will no doubt be a
relatively quick death. However, all around the house the dead have stopped in their tracks. You
here a loud creak from the front of the House and you rush to investigate it. Below you the front
door; the Gate has just collapsed in on itself! The Presence has either deliberately or accidentally
broken it and without its power or the Doom Demon's life-force, Hell is starting to leave this
place.

All around you the dead start to simply wink out of existence. Then the heavens open and an
immeasurable torrent of rain falls upon the estate, even succeeding in putting out the raging fire
that surrounded the House. Below you the usual mixture of screams or whispering or sounds of
pain start to disappear, as do the distant screams of the damned. Without warning the sky is
suddenly flooded by shooting balls of light that are even as you watch flying up from the House
and its estate; no doubt the souls of the damned have just been set free.

Looking back to the ground the army of the dead has all but disappeared and the circle of trees is
just that: nothing but a harmless collection of burnt out old husks. Behind you the vast fiery
opening has formed what can only be a smile, but this smile quickly becomes a frown when the
entire House at that very moment collapses completely in on itself.

You throw caution to the heavens and leap from the roof just as it falls and you land safely on the
roof of the grounds man's house some feet below. Then you jump from the little white house and
run through the remaining dead and towards the exit of this estate. Behind you the House is even
now falling in on itself into one giant burning mass.


When you are a safe distant from it and the few remaining dead you turn back and watch in
wonderment as the entire House starts to fall into the earth! Before it does though a few dozen
more of those shining lights free themselves from it and shoot off into the sky and towards the
heavens. Below them the entire area where the house stood is now a gaping hole filled with fire
and even as you watch in disbelief that hole starts to close like a giant mouth until there's nothing
left but burnt earth.

You look around yourself and find that you are now, as far as you are concerned the only living
thing left in the entire estate. All the dead have gone as are you have no doubt all of the damned
and other poor tortured lost souls. Turning around, you make your way back past the burnt trees
and on to the gates of this estate. Your eyes widen when you get to the gates and the fence that
they sit in for the entire structure is now rusty beyond comprehension, as if they have stood there
for decades. Mindful, still, of what happened to the last person you saw touch the gates, you aim
a mighty kick at them and are astounded when both of the huge things simply fall from their
hinges and lay harmlessly upon the ground.

Walking through those old gates gives you an immense and well-deserved feeling of relief.
Indeed you are positively elated. Your mission is complete: the Gate is closed, the House is
destroyed and Yarles is dead.

A voice from the darkness ahead of you startles you, but you are even more startled to recognise
the owner of the voice as your favourite nurse from the asylum!

You tell her that you give yourself up and will come quietly, wondering even as you say this as
to where the police and men in white coats are.

This just makes the nurse laugh, &quot;You don't need to go back to the asylum anymore because you
are completely cured from your phobias.&quot;

You stop in your tracks and examine yourself inwardly but her words almost instantly ring true;
you honestly feel for the first time in years that you do not suffer from any phobias or anxieties
at all. You smile at her and ask her how she knew

The nurse just smiles back at you, &quot;I advise you to get a new identity a new job and perhaps start
a family.&quot;

You tell her that you haven't thought about those sorts of things in decades.

&quot;Then it's about time that you did. Your mission is now complete and that's the only reward we
can offer you.&quot;

You wonder who 'we' is?

The nurse holds up a hand when she sees you are about to speak, &quot;We can no longer watch over
you or help you in any way. We must now leave you to find your own path in this world. I
realise that what you have gone through and endured is incredible and that few others perhaps no
others could have done so. Nevertheless we could rarely directly intervene and so one of the few
small ways we tried to help you is by making sure that you just happened to have those four
special items that you thought you had just by chance. I still realise that it's not much but we
have rules too and some may not even be bent let alone broken.&quot;

There's that 'we' again.

You all but ignore her strange words and simply tell her that you have no money instead.

The nurse starts to walk away from you but tells you over her shoulder, &quot;The few keepsakes you
have from the House should suffice to get you started.&quot; Then she is swallowed completely by
shadows and is gone.


You must admit that you do have one or two things upon you that may well be worth a bit of
money, not least a certain gold ring. Then you suddenly realise that you have left the Spear in
your haste to escape the House. You call after the nurse.

A voice drifts back to you from nowhere in particular, &quot;Leave it. It is hidden from evil and,
because of Yarle's failure, Hell has no interest in it now anyway.&quot;

You ask her about everybody else and what if it is needed another time.

&quot;It will be found again if required.&quot;

Then there is silence no matter how many questions you ask.

You shrug your shoulders and with a sad little smile you turn around for one last look at the
estate behind you. All you find is barren weed-encrusted ground, fallen railings and an old circle
of ancient burnt out husks of trees. As for the House itself, the only thing that's left of it is a large
rectangular patch of scorched earth at the centre of the grounds. You wonder if anything will
ever grow there again, if anything will ever so much as hint at its ever having been there in the
first place. Or will it just remain a pathetic and forgotten patch of dirt that lays unremembered
until the entire estate is choked with weeds and hidden forever from the rest of the world.

A fitting end, you think, for a House of Pain.

The groundkeeper's house squats amid the shadows of several tall trees, the limbs of which seem
to turn away from it at awkward and unnatural angles, almost as if they do not want to touch it.
You walk right up to the dwelling and can not help but get the feeling that it is looking at you.
The door, which is unlocked, is a pristine white that really shines in the darkness, almost like
teeth; and when you push it open and walk in, you feel like you are walking into a mouth.

Inside the house is deathly quiet. It is also completely devoid of furniture, there are not even any
carpets or wallpaper, although someone has at least taken the trouble to paint the walls red. You
are standing in a small lounge-like area that leads immediately onto a kitchen; at least this is
what you assume. After all, the only thing that tells you that the kitchen is probably a kitchen is
that there is waist-high counter that juts out of the wall ahead of you, leaving a space between it


and the wall which would be door-sized. This counter separates the two `rooms', giving them the

that grasp it. Shamefully, you accidentally break some of the brittle fingers right off as you are
removing the stake from them. At last you have it though and place it in your belt. Presently, you
turn around to face the room and are shocked to your core when confronted with ghostly images
resembling the man and the woman in the bed! If you suffer from Phasmophobia, turn to 254. If

Your chosen weapon has no effect on the dragon, juvenile or otherwise, old bones, old magic or
otherwise. You simply cannot expect that this type of weapon will do any noticeable damage to
this type of creature.

It rears still further above you, sending down a few loose bits of stone as its head brushes the

stream from the hole above it is redirected through its skull. Then there's nothing but a
reverberating snap of jaws and darkness as the Death Dragon begins to grind your bones...

North. There is a sudden silence down this short section, no whispering, no moans of the dead,
no heartbeat of the House. It's as if you've just walked into a bubble, separate from the rest of the
world. Then you hear it. A distant bell, much like that of a church, but distorted as if it the sound
were being played backwards. Besides you the walls have become stuck on red and, beneath the
wallpaper, or whatever it is, you are sure of movement here and there. You walk on quickly and
reach a junction flowing left and right. It's at this junction that you become aware of the moans
of the dead and the heartbeat of the House again, together with something else on the edge of
hearing: laughter or screaming you can't tell which. To the left the corridor passes a couple of
dark passages to the south and quickly ends at a heavily boarded up door. To the right it

current condition but doubly so because of the horned horror that could well still be awaiting
you. Drenched in sweat, you crawl along to the front door, expecting to be attacked at any

This is not real, I refuse to believe it.

You open your eyes. The cupboard door is a few feet behind you, open and welcoming. Your
hands are on nothing but a wooden floor. You smile and sweep your hands across the wood for a

small ... metal ... a key! You grab it, back calmly out of the little place you are in, close its door
and look smilingly at the key. It fits easily into the palm of your hand, is silver in colour but
made from copper, has a sword design upon its spine, and the name Alexandrian upon its head.
Pondering the name for a while you soon realise that it must be a less than subtle reference to
Alexander the Great: one of the most renowned warriors ever to wield a sword.

Each and every time the Plague Demon hits you some of the rats crawling over it will attach

the Demon hit you twice and 3 if it manages it three times and so on. This Stamina drain is in

The metal door is named Armis and it creaks open and lets into a gloomy room lit only by a
single candle spluttering by the door. You are delighted to find that this room is brimming with
weapons of all kinds: obviously an armoury after all. At first you are elated at the thought of
finally getting your hands on a real means of self defence. Your hopes are somewhat dashed then
when your eyes adjust to the gloom and you become conscious of the fact that each and every
weapon here is either broken or rusty beyond belief. At first you find it difficult to comprehend
that every sword adoring the walls, every axe leaning in a corner and every mace, quarterstaff,
dagger and polearm presented in front of you, is in truly horrible condition.

Letting forth a sigh and stepping further amongst the various tools of war, the candle behind you
casting odd shadows, you decide which thing to take with you. In spite of everything, even this
sorry collection is better than what you have. After a few minutes examining the poor quality
goods on sale you make out three of them that are less awful than the others.

They are a blunt sword, an old axe and a very rusty mace.

The door opens soundlessly on well-oiled hinges and sweeps smoothly inwards. You stand on
the threshold a moment, alert for danger, but take in an old fashioned Victorian-style games
room. The ceiling is high, the walls are draped with various colourful hangings and the floor is
covered with a very soft but still heavy-looking purple carpet. Several comfortable-looking
brown leather chairs and a small fireplace finish the scene.

There are of course a smattering of games here too. There is a billiards table, cards table, darts
board and a chess set. The billiards table has an unusual beige-coloured cloth instead of the usual
green. The darts board enclosed in a wooden case with a carving of a laughing cherub on each
door. The cards sport the oddest designs you have ever witnessed, at least from this distance.
Only the chess set here seems remotely normal, complete with the usual pieces, carved from
ivory, and set upon a beautifully worked mahogany board. It seems you have several choices

You open the door a crack and are assailed by a wall of hoarse laughter. You are standing on the
threshold of what you take to be a drama studio. At the back is a stage with a heavy curtain
pulled open at either side. Above the stage are floodlights that illuminate the darkened
performers below. In front of all this are dozens of chairs aligned in rows. It is from the
occupants of these chairs that the laughter is emanating from.

Looking for all the world as though they are actually growing from the chairs they are sat on are
men and women whose arms and legs are literally imbedded in the chairs they occupy. This is so
much so that it's quite difficult to work out in this level of light where each chair ends and each
person begins.

Taking a closer look at a few of the people you quickly find out why they are laughing in that
hoarse manner you noticed. It's because some sort of horrible spell has been cast upon them
forcing them to laugh until their throats bleed. Indeed, many of them obviously have blood in
their mouths and on their chins. Yet still they laugh manically and uncontrollably. Raising your
eyes to the stage you notice what could well be the children of some of these men and women.
At first you take them to be acting out some kind of grisly play.

When your eyes adjust to the gloom the full horror of what is occurring is made apparent to you.
The children are stabbing each other with real knives and strangling each other with real rope.
Yet they do not die and just carry on and on in silence with tears in their eyes.

Ignoring the few knotted trees around you, you pick your way past the scraggly collection of
bushes and approach the centre of the island. It is here that you find a solitary gravestone. At first
glance it is an ordinary affair, straight sided and curve topped. However it is positively covered
in a wild collection of what you can only assume to be some kind of writing, although it matches
nothing you have ever come across before. In fact, it resembles nothing more than the twisted
ranting of a mad man, perhaps only offering the merest resemblance to any language through
shear chance. The more you stare at these insane offerings the more you become aware of
something clutching at the back of your mind, like some ancient memory struggling to explain
itself to you, or to warn. It's as if the `words' themselves were actual creatures that live on the


pitted stone of the grave and, were you to turn your head for a moment, they would reform into

southern door and then splits into two north options almost side by side.

The first northern option soon leads to a door called 'Cantus'. It's beautifully decorated with

impossibly long exit with many more south-facing exits to your left. Next to you is such a large
stalagmite that it reaches right to the ceiling and has actually formed a sort of make-shift column.
The runes around you pulse when you look closely at this new structure. Ahead of you lies a
dead end. Before that though is a trio of doors to your right. The first of which has such a thick

touch the web you are shocked by just how quickly they take hold, sending off rivers of fire in all
directions and multiplying whenever they meet a new junction. Of course the Death Spider
wakes up. Of course it regards you with the utmost malice and of course it races towards you,
seemingly ignorant of the flames. Unfortunately for it, the web its spun has already been
weakened by the fire and it only takes a thread or to two break before the whole thing collapses
in on itself, sending the Death Spider spiralling silently into the blackness below.

Far beneath you there seems to be a struggle, then stillness. Shrugging your shoulders in
disbelief, you walk carefully around the yawning chasm to the other side.

balefully. There is no disgusting carpet here though and this, together with the aforementioned

the lost souls that were in his way. Through that ragged opening you can see a few dim stars and
a moon now partially hidden by clouds. A gentle rain has started to fall and even now a few
droplets are falling softly on your skin. It feels an age since you have felt the rain or smelt fresh
air. As luck would have it the ceiling has broken in such a way as to allow you a few easy hand
and footholds to escape this room.

You do so.


Once on the roof you instantly spot a great creature crawling through the darkness towards you at
times pitch black and at times barely lit by the passing of the clouds from the moon. When it is
mere yards from away you let out a gasp of sheer horror as you realise the full extent of what you
must now face. It is no longer Yarles at all; it is what he has become, perhaps what he always
was behind all his illusions and hypnosis: a colossal fiend that would have barely been able to
stand upright if it were still in the House. The fa�ade of the man has crumbled completely and
now his true form is apparent in all its unbearable horror.

Yarles is a Doom Demon.

A forgotten ancient from the netherworld, one of the most dangerous monstrosities to have ever
spewed forth from that pit.

The Doom Demon rears up, blocking out the stars with its bulk. Lightning flashes and briefly
illuminates its vast build: Its legs are like tree-trunks, its arms are as thick as your body and an
impossibly large gaping mouth has replaced its face. At least that is what you at first you take it
to resemble, but as you gaze in awe at the giant squirming mass towering above you, you make a
further revolting discovery: the creature is made entirely from the living bodies of human beings.

Add 3  FEAR  points.

As awful and unbelievable as it is to even comprehend it is quite true: its left and right 'legs' both
comprise of two screaming people knotted together. Its 'arms' are similarly constructed. Its 'body'
is merely two crying souls smashed and wound together, whilst its 'head' is one poor man whose
crushed body has been twisted to form a massive 'mouth'.

You back away in terror and revulsion as the squirming, screaming blasphemy shakes the roof as
it 'walks' towards you.

Seizing your chance you leap forward and slam the stake straight through her heart. She screams
so loudly that the hangings within the room actually shake. Then her eyes close once more and
she is still.

Getting up and dusting yourself down you turn your back on her again and make ready to leave,
but not before you check your belongings for you feel that Yarles is close.

Behind you a lily-white arm reaches slowly up and fixes itself around the stake and slowly starts
to pull it out.

You uncover a few nails and a couple of finger bones but not much else. At that moment, on the
verge of giving up your search, your fingers close around the familiar shape of a key. Pulling it
from the pocket where you found it you turn it around and notice that it is large and iron and has
a crown engraved upon it. You wonder if this 'king's' key isn't in fact the Master Bedroom key.

The noise that caused you to turn round was the black ooze hitting the floor. It now completely
covers the door and the hair now resembles that of a woman's. Then something reaches up
through the mass and pulls itself onto the floor in front of you: a girl perhaps, except that she has
no face and all of her nails are broken. Her body has a sickening bluish tinge as though she had
been drowned.

Then there's her hair, still growing and moving independently from her, snaking towards you as

You march on under the stalactites and get the distinct and rather odd impression that they are
ancient, older than the earth itself. Shaking off the strange feeling, you discover a long dark

It's no good; your muscles are too tired to keep you ahead of the blasphemy that is approaching
you. In the next second it has gripped your boat and has started to drag it towards its immense
bulbous head. You shine your torch at its eyes again but it just closes them having already learnt
from its previous mistake. The next thing you know, in a moment of stark horror, is the full
realisation of what is about to happen to you. Fear consumes and breaks your mind as the thing's
tentacles began to drag the boat under whilst you are still in it. Then, as it begins to submerge the


boat completely, a cold rubbery tentacle snakes around your waist and prepares to sink back into
darkness and oblivion. You do not cry out. You do not move. Your sanity has been shattered and
you do nothing as the creature hauls you under.

The last the world ever witnesses of you is your doll-stiff, tear-streaked face as it disappears

The third time you are hit you feel an awful sensation push through your body as though it were
being pulled in on itself. Unfortunately this means that you have succumbed to the poison from
the ghoul's claws and must now suffer the consequences.

Your joints seize up and your muscles constrict as your movements become ever slower until
you can barely move at all. The ghoul is well aware of your predicament and stands back
watching you whilst you paralyse completely. When you can't move at all it moves in close to
your face and opens its jaws wide.

What happens next is so appalling that even the House itself falls into a tomblike silence, as if
there were some deaths too horrible for even it to bare...

With a roar that shakes the House, the humungous form of the Hell Demon crashes to the floor,
the Kris-knife still imbedded in its chest. Before you can so much as let out a sigh, its body starts
to disappear piece by piece, back into the pit that spawned it. In a matter of seconds the great
beast has gone completely, Kris-knife and all. You mourn the loss of the knife but feel thankful
for owning it for the short time you did.

Then you notice a small piece of creamy white paper on the floor. Picking it up you're surprised
to find it written on in English. It reads simply, 'Wall of Blood' and has the number 41 daubed on
its reverse in what you hope is red ink.. You can only assume that this is part of the information
required to access the so-called 'secret room'. A huge flood of relief pours over you.

Add 1  LUCK  point and deduct 1  FEAR  point.

Turning your attention back to the room, you remember the large flaming torches, just the sort of
things that the undead are afraid of. However, if you suffer from Pyrophobia you must add 1
FEAR point. If it's your Primal Fear then you must force yourself to do what you're attempting and
must spend 1    LUCK  point and add 2   FEAR points. Wrenching one from the wall and opening the
door, you step out into the dead-filled corridor. Quite unexpectedly though, they don't rush you,
moaning and wailing as they are. This is because they are, quite incredibly, attacking the
impassive from of the Horned Demon. This does not seem to faze it in the slightest and it merely
tries to walk through a veritable wall of the undead. Luckily for you, as strong as it is, even it is
no match for this grisly army and simply remains there trying futilely to walk forward whilst
being swamped by the undead.

You are just about to smile, laugh or even mock the Horned Demon when you notice another
large form heading your way, ignored by the groaning dead. This new form is the familiar
bandaged musty one you've been avoiding for so long. The moment the mummy is within reach
you ram the large torch into its chest, knocking it backwards. It looks down at its chest, removes
the torch and throws it at some nearby curtains which instantly start to catch fire. Unfortunately
for the bone-dry mummy, it becomes a towering inferno within seconds. It still walks towards
you though, arms outstretched, silent as ever, burning so fiercely that you can hardly see it


anymore. It crashes to the ground smashing the torch to pieces, just before it reaches you; setting
the already slightly burning carpet completely alight all around its still form.

Almost clapping your hands with joy, you make ready to run past it when you notice the burning
mummy raise its form slightly and point at you. Then it collapses. Wondering what on earth that
was all about you make ready to get away when a thudding jolt rips right through you; a ringing
in your ears, a sinking feeling in the pit of your stomach, an awful sensation that someone is
preparing your grave. You have been cursed with a new phobia! To discover the effects of the
curse you must roll 2 dice and consult the following table:

If you roll a 2 you now have Aquaphobia
If you roll a 3 you now have Cartilogenophobia
If you roll a 4 you now have Catoptrophobia
If you roll a 5 you now have Claustrophobia
If you roll a 6 you now have Dysmorphophobia
If you roll a 7 you now have Insectophobia
If you roll a 8 you now have Musophobia
If you roll a 9 you now have Mysophobia
If you roll a 10 you now have Phasmophobia
If you roll a 11 you now have Pyrophobia
If you roll a 12 you now have Toxiphobia

If you roll a phobia that you've already got, that phobia is now your new Primal Fear and your
old Primal Fear is now reduced to an ordinary phobia. If you happen to roll the phobia that is
already your Primal Fear then you have been lucky and the curse has not affected you and you
may Add 1   LUCK  point instead.

If you do not like the new phobia you've been cursed with you may Test your Luck and if Lucky,
roll the dice again. You may Test your Luck as many times as you want to.

You jump over its body and race for the staircase, just as more of the carpet and another set of
curtains catch fire; yet safe in the knowledge that the dead won't approach these flames and are
too busy trying to eat the Horned Demon anyway. You turn your back on the grisly, blazing
scene and walk up the stairs. Turn to 261.

shaking uncontrollably but even now, as you die on the floor in a pool of filth, you can't help but

As soon as you are free of the fog you notice a door to your right. The wood is scorched like the
others but it would seem only half-heartedly. The portal itself is covered in faded pictures of toys

profoundly sad about this. Upon the door merely written in pencil in a childish scrawl is

The instant you are through you are alone in a rickety old house in the middle of endless woods.
It's full of creaks and other odd sounds as you creep through it trying to find a way out, except
there are no doors and all of the windows are bricked up.

A moaning sound makes itself apparent as some sort of hooded and dishevelled apparition
manifests itself in the shadows and comes floating towards you. Turning, you run upstairs but the
house seems endless and on every floor you can still here the horrible moaning thing gently
floating towards you through the cold air. Eventually you reach an empty stone room and you

opening out into a little square-ish cave with no apparent exits. This cave is full of tables and
shelves crammed with jars and bottles of colourful bubbling liquids. All around you reds, blues

This fact is confirmed when you spy two large dusty cauldrons sitting opposite each other in the

It's a well decorated bedroom complete with large four-poster bed. The walls have a pleasant
peach wallpaper on them and the floor has a soft white carpet. Across this floor from where you

Your eyes wandering the room you take note of a small writing desk and a plain wooden chair in
front of it. Next to this is a short bookstand crammed with many volumes. However the whole
scene is thickly covered in dust and has obviously not been disturbed in years, if not decades.
Back to the impressive four-poster you are startled to notice that there are the mummified
corpses of an old man and woman within the moth-eaten covers. Your shock turns to pity when

Leaving the junction, you head for the white dome to the northwest. As you pass under the trees
and into shadow you get the unnerving feeling that even the silence itself is listening. Rejecting
this odd notion you follow the path as it twists snake-like through the undergrowth, keeping your
eyes firmly ahead of you, always on the little dirty streak of mud that you are following,
desperate to keep to it and avoid walking through the trees directly. Although quite why you are
so keen to avoid them is something unknown even to you. Perhaps you are convinced that there is
something in there, just off the path watching you from the shadows, baring its white fangs,
observing your progress with its red eyes, just waiting for the moment when your back is fully
turned.

Blink.

You shake of the somewhat nasty feelings managing to creep upon you and are relieved to find
that you are about to break free of the trees and start walking on the path that leads directly to the
white dome of the mausoleum. The path turns white as it heads to the impressive structure; each
side of it is thick with grass and it takes some time for you to notice the subtle horror that the
unkempt lawn contains: open graves. You shudder at their presence but are determined to ignore
the foreboding sense of dread weighing upon you. Unfortunately, a few further steps onward and
an even worse shock presents itself to you: a series of dilapidated and forgotten gravestones lay
overlooked in the thickest of grass furthest on and, from each of them, you can hear sounds of
scratching and crying. This latest of terrors makes you feel positively sick to your stomach but
you successfully force down the bile rising in your throat and head ever onwards to the dome.

Just then, something limps awkwardly out of the shadows from next to the mausoleum,
something that brings the sickening stench of rotten flesh with it. As the unknown figure
shambles through the dark towards you, you notice a rat drop off its neck and quickly scramble
away behind a nearby tombstone, where the sounds of eating can then be heard. You put a hand
over your mouth and take several steps back. At that moment the shambling thing then steps into
the moonlight and you take a step back in horror.

The undead creature is you.

Add 1  FEAR point.


You stare at its caved-in face, its eyeless sockets, its torn neck and ruined, disfigured body but
there can be no doubt that the abomination staggering towards you with its arms out-stretched
looks exactly like you, right down to your clothes, shoes and hair.

You take a step back in fear and disbelief. The creature takes another step towards you and opens
its bloody mouth, revealing broken, blackened teeth. However, rather than try to bite you it stops
in front of you and emits some sort of horrible gurgling sound from its ripped throat, sending
blood trickling down its neck as it does so. You are not sure but you could swear the thing is
trying to communicate with you. In fact, amidst the painful sounding gurgling, there is a definite
attempt at a single word. It takes you a few horrified moments to try and work out what it is
attempting to say, and then it hits you: the creature is asking for `Help'.

You are dumbfounded and find yourself at a loss at what to do. Your confusion is short-lived
though because the creature takes a final pitiful step towards you before, quite literally, falling
apart in front of you. It simply disintegrates before your eyes, until the only thing left is a pile of
diseased flesh and yellowed bone. The sight in front of you, shocking though it has been, sends a
tear down your cheek. What was the creature: a trick, a warning, or an omen? You may never
know but you are resolved to continue your mission.

At last you reach the mausoleum and peer into the semi-darkness therein, for it is still lit a little
from the moon above. You enter and take in the roundness of the walls, and the several
sarcophaguses, some large, some small, that fan out from the centre, leaving just enough room for
you to walk through them and approach a central tomb, higher and more ornate than the rest. As
you do so you become aware of a subtle metallic noise behind you and are shocked to find a
metal portcullis sneaking down over the only exit to this place. Panic rises within you and you
rush towards the opening and salvation, but the moment you start your run the portcullis quickly
slams down, sealing you within this crypt. If you suffer from Claustrophobia, turn to 232. If you
do not, you turn your full attention to the portcullis, turn to 56.

The heavy key fits into the lock smoothly enough and turns without any noticeable resistance.
'Here I must leave y-you,' says the old servant, 'all our hopes are w-with y-you.' With that, he
runs back to his room and barricades it.

Turning your attention back to the door, ignoring the dead approaching through the shadows, you
take one final deep breath and open the door.

Inside is a very small and surprisingly bare room. In fact the only item of furniture is a small
table at the far end of it. Upon this table are dozens of skulls, carefully piled pyramid-fashion,
giving off the impression of an unholy altar. Above the alter and on each of the walls burns a
single powerful torch. Laid out in a circle in the centre of the room are dozens of lit candles. In
the middle of these candles and sitting with his back to you, is a small thin man.

'Impressive isn't it,' asks the man, with a slight nod at the skull-altar.

You have no idea what to say in return so just draw the Kris-knife instead.


'I'd lock the door if I were you, says the thin man in a calm voice, 'we don't want the dead
breaking in whilst we do business.'

You find yourself surprised at how level his voice is and equally surprised at how normal his
appearance is, and yet this is one of Yarles' most trusted servants? You find yourself doing as the
thin man asks anyway, almost against your will as if he were using some kind of mind control on
you. If you suffer from claustrophobia, you must add 1      FEAR  point. If it's your Primal Fear you
must add 3    FEAR  points instead. Upon you locking the door, he stands up and turns toward you.
His face is drawn and humourless, his expression is dignified and yet forgettable. He certainly
looks like a butler you have to admit.

'That's because we always look like the last person we ate,' says the thin man in a level tone.
Your eyes widen and yet you approach him anyway. His eyes drop to your knife and then he
speaks once more, his gaze never leaving it, 'Good. That shall help me transform just that bit
quicker but it will not help you here. With that last remark, you leap at him and slash at his chest.
The thin man doesn't move or even blink; his expression remains one of dignity, almost blank;
devoid of emotion. 'Thank you,' he says simply.

Without warning, two great horns burst from his head and his jaw stretches down to below his
neck, then shaggy hair sprouts all over his body. His skin blackens and smoke starts to pour from
his mouth, nose and eyes, his face twists and distorts until it's no longer recognisable. His entire
body then starts to grow taller and muscular. His feet turn to hooves and his hands turn to claws
until at last it stands before you, its horns scraping the ceiling ten feet above you, the bulk of its
body blocking out the alter behind it completely: the beast you now face is a Hell Demon.

Add 3   FEAR points.

As you are using the Kris-knife in this fight and because this creature is vulnerable to it, you may
add 6 points to your Attack Strength for this fight only. However, if you suffer from the
aforementioned claustrophobia, you may only add 5 points to your Attack Strength for this
encounter. If it's your Primal Fear, you may only add a lowly 3 points to your Attack Strength for
this encounter.

What's more, because this is a newly-formed Hell Demon, it's particularly vulnerable to the thing
that made it. Ergo, each strike with the Kris-knife will cause this particular enemy 4 points of
STAMINA  damage instead of the usual 2.

The Hell Demon, its face contorted into a mocking smile, its mouth stretched so wide that blood
seeps from the corners, takes one goat-hoofed step towards you, horns still brushing the ceiling,
mouth and eyes still emitting smoke.

a lake. Below your feet there is a comfortable beige carpet and above you is a richly decorated
ceiling covered in delicate swirls of plaster. The shear normality of this room almost takes you
aback. Regardless of this you guess yourself to be in a reception room, so near the front door as
it is and furnished with a desk and several nice chairs. Clearly this is, or was, a room designed to

bit of the place that so-called less distinguished people got to witness.

You lash out as new voices and laughter reverberate around you but you simply cannot hope to

Quiet footsteps pad towards you and a gleeful voice can be heard in your ear, 'A pity you won't

Remembering the codebook you picked up earlier, you decide to have a good look at it,
comparing the illustrations to the carvings on the door. Before long, you have it! The images tell
you to perform a complex series of prods at various parts of the door: a dragon's head here, a
demon's hoof there, a man's sword near the top of the frame, another man's shield near the base
and so on. A click causes your ears to prick up as you notice, in the centre of the door, an image
of a spear head slowly turning inwards until its tip is now pointing into the door. Gazing closer,

It creaks on its hinges as you cautiously push it open and enter into, not a room as you'd
expected, but a large cave. It takes a few moments for your eyes to adjust because it's so dingy in
here and the only light source is a shaft of moonlight coming from a small hole at the back of the
cave.


Whilst your eyes are adjusting you don't notice the door closing soundlessly behind you.

When you can see properly you are staggered to find that the cave is full of huge bones. Indeed
you appear to be standing in a massive ribcage and staring at a monstrous skull some distance
ahead of you. Whatever this creature used to be, it was big.

If you suffer from Cartilogenophobia you must add 1     FEAR  point, but if it's your Primal Fear, you
must add 2  FEAR points.

At the other end of the cave, bathed in the trickle of moonlight and sat on a white plinth carved
with demons, is what appears to be a wavy-bladed knife, glinting slightly as you look at it. Idly,
you turn round to make sure you have an escape route in case something happens only to find, of
course, that the door is now closed. Your heart beats in your ears and your throat becomes so dry
that it becomes difficult to swallow. It seems the only thing you can do now is investigate the
strange knife at the other end of the cave.

Bones crunch under foot as you walk carefully through the ribcage and then by the elongated
neck section. Looking down you are suddenly afraid when you realise that the bones of much
more than one creature are here because there are dozens of human skulls peeping out from
below the earth and everyone one of them has been crushed or damaged in some way. There are
also smashed ribcages and even entire skeletons here and there and almost everyone has been
heavily damaged. Nevertheless, you continue on your grisly march, crunching through the carpet
of dead, all the while shadowed by the great skeleton beside you until at last, when level with its
huge dinosaur-like head, you reach out for the knife; your hand snakes through the air, parting
the moonlight, disturbing the motes of dust, distorting the shadows around the plinth as you
reach, fingers out-stretched, reach, finger-tips brushing the hilt of the knife and, that's it.

You spin like a top as a monstrous grinding sound is heard right behind you and the hairs on the
back of your neck stand on end at the sight that greets you. The giant dinosaur-like skeleton is
reforming right as you watch. The huge bones are scraping across the floor and attaching
themselves to each other as the backbone and legs takes shape as well as the - wings? - of the
creature. Each time one bone joins another there's a small flash of blue light indicating some dark
magic at work here.

More and more bones come together so that the creature can rise up on four fully formed legs
and then dip forward so that the neck bones attach in a rushing clutter of movement. All you can
do is watch in terror as each bone links to another and the thing becomes more fully formed. At
last the neck comes together and reaches down for the skull. Then both the cranium and the
lower jaw come together snapping as they do so. The neck raises the skull high in the air,
brushing the roof of the cavern, then dipping downwards so that the - yes - the dragon can look
at you with empty eye sockets.

This creature is a Death Dragon, a skeletal monstrosity held together by magic. Luckily for you,
it has not been reanimated from the remains of a fully grown dragon but rather a juvenile.
Furthermore, the magic that holds it together and the bones themselves are now so old that they
are weak. Unluckily for you this is still a highly dangerous foe that stands before you.

Add 1   FEARpoint.

There is no escape and nowhere to hide and so you must fight this new terror as it looms over
you. Now make a life-or-death decision as to what type of weapon you will use to battle it. If you

it in place of your current weapon. You must quickly make your choice.

It throws its head back and screams louder than any sound you have ever heard, forcing you to
cover your ears, which start to bleed; all the while the thing still convulses and twists but still
manages to half-walk, half-fall towards you, its face contorted beyond recognition, its claws
swiping at you. It seems the thing, although heavily weakened, still has some fight left in her, no,
not her, it. This thing is not human and you must force yourself to fight.

You just reach out to the padlock. The moment you do, you hear a sudden commotion behind
you, causing you to instantly hunch your shoulders and whip your head round. Hands are coming
up through the earth all around you. A stench of blood fills the air as dozens of rotten corpses
extract themselves from the ground, filling the air with pitiful moans. There are too many to fight
and too many to run through and so you just stand there, transfixed, as they stagger and crawl
towards you, opening and shutting their jaws incessantly, dragging themselves closer to you;
eyeless sockets, skinless hands, tongues protruding through broken jaws, pouring blood and
slime as they approach you. You do not move but rather stand as one paralysed. Even as the first
of the rotten army grab you and bite you, you do not cry out. You just stand endure the agony.

Sometime later, as the filthy corpses sink back into the earth, an observer from the House may
have taken note that there was an extra one within their midst. This new one has had most of the
flesh torn from its arms and face and was trailing some intestines as it dug itself back into the
earth, but there was still no doubt about it, it looked exactly like you ...

aware of two large dogs lolloping towards you across the moonlit green. At first they seem like
normal animals until they pass though the shadow of an ominous cloud and burst out into relative

The little man thanks you. &quot;This House is being dragged into hell,&quot; he says matter-of-factly. He
notices your raised eyebrows and shakes his head, &quot;you must have seen things by now, you must
know that what I speak is the truth?&quot;

You have to admit that, either he is talking sense, or he's just as crazy as you are.

&quot;Listen up,&quot; continues the little man. &quot;The Lord of this manner is a powerful demon, the brother
of the Earl of Drummer who you may have heard of?&quot; The little man catches the brief but grim
smile on your lips. &quot;Ah, I see that you are at least partially acquainted with his story.&quot; He nods in
satisfaction. This new lord styles himself Yarles and is just as dangerous as the last. He doesn't
want what happened to his brother to happen to him, so this time he's not taking any chances. He
intends to open something I've overheard referred to as 'The Gate'.&quot; He notices your puzzled
expression and shrugs his shoulders once again. Then he removes his glasses and starts to idly
polish them on his shirt as he continues.

&quot;I don't pretend to know what The Gate is,&quot; he says, a faraway look in his eyes, &quot;but all I know is
that the last time he tried to open it all hell broke loose.&quot; He notices he suddenly has your
undivided attention. Replacing his glasses, he continues. &quot;The last time he tried something went
wrong and although the gate did open, it opened to the wrong place.&quot; He stops at your
incredulous expression. &quot;I'm only telling you what I've heard,&quot; he strokes his beard, &quot;and I'm not
entirely sure I believe it myself,&quot; he continues almost as if to himself. &quot;The last time something
came through, all I've heard is that they call it The Presence. Well, this thing will kill anything:
human, demon or angel, it simply doesn't care. What's worse is that it's not even a physical thing
and so no weapons seem to stop harm it, let alone stop it.&quot;

You ask the little man where the Presence is now.

&quot;Oh, it's been lying low for some time now,&quot; he answers, &quot;hopefully it's gone elsewhere, but I
don't know. Every now and again, although not for a while, we've found some truly disgusting
remains of God knows what.&quot; He stares up at the ceiling for some moments. &quot;Suffice to say
Yarles lord wants to open it again and this time bring through whatever the hell it is that he wants
to bring through. I hazard a guess that whatever this thing is, it will make him invulnerable to
attack or perhaps just protect him in some way, or maybe make him immortal even. I just don't
know.&quot;

You ask him how on earth this 'Gate' was opened in the first place.

The old man grimaces, &quot;I'm not sure that even I believe this next bit and I certainly don't expect
you to.&quot; He takes a deep breath, adjusts his glasses and continues. &quot;Have you ever heard of the
Spear of Destiny?&quot; He smiles as your eyes widen. &quot;I told you it was hard to believe. Well, the
only way to open this Gate, so I've heard, is to commit only the foulest of blasphemies. Put
simply, waving around a few inverted crosses and killing a couple of maidens just isn't good
enough. No. You need something truly holy to deal with the truly unholy. It's the only way those
things on the other side will take notice. So, Yarles scoured the world for the holy spear and, after
three decades and a lot of torture, he found it, intact and unharmed in some tiny church in some
tiny country whose name escapes me.&quot;

You accidentally let out an sceptical snort.

The little man raises his eyebrows, &quot;Well I can see that you're not very religious.&quot;

You tell him that religion has nothing to do with it and that it's just too unbelievable to be true,
that's all, no disrespect.


The little man removes his glasses and stares at you. &quot;I'm not a religious man either, not until I
came here anyway. Suffice to say, I also didn't believe in demons, zombies or monsters either and
I assume you've changed your mind about most of those by now?&quot; He notices your slight
nodding. &quot;Anyway, after a barrage of tests he was finally satisfied that he had the genuine spear.
Of course he used it straight away in some God-forsaken ceremony in some sickening act that I
won't even attempt to relate to you.&quot; The little man once again turns his eyes to the ceiling as if
searching for something unseen. &quot;Of course the ceremony went wrong and the spear broke in
two.&quot;

You ask him why this was.

&quot;Because the spear was never meant to be used by such a foul creature. After that there was a
life-and-death struggle between the so-called 'lord' Yarles, his henchman and the remaining poor
souls that weren't deemed necessary. In the fight, two brave men made off with the remains of
the Spear. One ran upstairs and one ran down, but I don't know what they did with their halves of
the Spear. I mean they must still be in the House somewhere because, as I'm sure you've found
out by now, it's impossible to leave this estate.&quot; He replaces his glasses and looks back at you.
&quot;The lord once again scoured the world for the knowledge of how to fix that Spear and he
actually found it fairly easily and fairly close to home, if the rumours are to be given any
credence, and I'm not sure they do.&quot; Another deep breath and a look right at you, &quot;the Spear
requires that four things, each blessed by seven religions, be attached to the Spear on and near the
break point.&quot; He looks momentarily angry at yet another incredulous look from you. &quot;Well I don't
claim to understand but I have it on good authority from a book I got from the so-called lord's
library that the reason for this formula is as follows,&quot; a third deep breath, &quot;four times seven is
meant to mimic in some way three times six.&quot; He grins at the realisation dawning on your face.
&quot;That's right! Four sevens trump three sixes!&quot; He laughs and even claps his hands.

You ask him about the emblems.

&quot;Well, they can be anything as long as they've been blessed by the seven different religions.&quot; He
gazes thoughtfully into the air for a while, &quot;but if you want my opinion, I should say the easiest
thing to attach to a spear without damaging it would probably be some sort of ribbon.&quot;

You nod in agreement.

The little man winks at you and continues yet again, &quot;Suffice to say that these ribbon's or
whatever they are, are hidden somewhere in the House, just waiting for the moment when the so-
called Lord Yarles once again has both halves of the Spear, assuming he doesn't have at least one
already. I don't think he has both yet, trust me, we'd know about it.&quot; He lets out a deep breath and
strokes his beard again, seemingly having finished his story.

You ask him what he thinks you should do.

&quot;I think you should find the spear-halves before Yarles does and find as many of these holy
emblems, these, 'ribbons' as you can. I'm not even sure if you'd need all four or not because you
are not him and he is not meant to use the Spear in the first place.&quot; He looks at you thoughtfully
for a while, &quot;but then again you're not a religious person, are you? I'm not sure how the rules will
apply to you, or even if they will.&quot; He returns his gaze to the ceiling once more.

You suddenly wonder to yourself as to exactly why you should want the Spear and the emblems
for yourself and you tell the little man as much.

&quot;Because without the Spear and at least a few emblems to fix it, you won't be able to harm him
when you confront him.&quot;

Your mouth drops open.

The little man hasn't noticed and continues, &quot;when he first used the spear his life-force became
entwined with it and now it is the only means of killing him.&quot; You are about to speak when the
little man raised a hand. &quot;Do you honestly think that I'd sit hear wasting my time talking to you


when I could be tortured and killed for it if anyone found out? Why, the only reason I'm still alive
is because Yarles has developed a bit of a taste for fine wine, and I'm very good at judging fine
wine. No, my friend, you are here for a reason, and that reason is to stop the so-called lord from
opening the Gate. Find the Spear, fix it with the holy emblems, kill this 'lord'. Kill Yarles. That's
all there is to it. Are you hungry?&quot; You stare at this sudden question. The little man reaches
behind him and through a few bottles, &quot;just a plate of fruit I have stashed away, that's all. It's all
yours.&quot;

He hands it to you and you may eat it now or stow it in your backpack. Whether you eat it now or
later there is just enough fruit for three hearty meals and each one will restore your        STAMINA by 4
points. You may not eat them when engaged in combat.

&quot;Don't forget the Presence either,&quot; he reminds you, &quot;it could be anywhere or perhaps even
anything. Just be careful, that's all.&quot;

You stand up, somewhat bewildered, somewhat bolstered, somewhat angry. Yet the little man has
told you an awful lot and has asked for nothing in return. Not only that but he's given you the
means to feed yourself and all without asking.

enough for him to place his fingers in. He does just that and quickly flicks some of his blood into
your eyes, forcing you to be sick over the writhing bodies at your feet. After this he reaches up
further and pulls one of his own eyes out! You simply cannot believe what you are seeing and
want to turn away but find that you unable to.

He then places his hands at his throat, rips it open and pulls from it a little bloody white object
which you assume must be part of his neck bone. He then places this in his mouth and swallows
it, where you even see it pass down what remains of his throat. After this he reaches down to his
chest, places his fingers into a wound, and forces it wide, until it is large enough for him to reach
in and pull his heart out! You look on in utter amazement as he then crushes his heart in his own
hands! He is still smiling through all of this but is not finished with his demonstration yet. He
finally places his hands on his stomach and tears another wound open wide, he then puts one of
his hands into the gaping, gory hole and brings forth what you can only assume to be the remains
of a human child. Yarle's then drops the little corpse, steps forward and crushes it beneath his
feet.

This last sickening display wakes you from your horrified trance-like state and you resolve to
defeat this foe here and now even if it means cutting him to pieces. Yarle's seems to sense that
you are still unperturbed and quickly raises one of his hands up to the roof, points, and then
brings it down to the writhing mass at his feet where black smoke instantly appears and snakes
upwards into a thick cloud. You grab your sword and make ready to run at him but he crouches
down, gathers his strength and makes a colossal leap upwards that sees him smash straight
through the ceiling and out onto the roof!

This last display of strength staggers you so much that you almost don't notice a fiery form
emerge from the black smoke in front of you. You snap out of your trance and gaze at the foe
you must now face. It resembles nothing more than a large suit of spiked amour wreathed in
flame! This armour carries a horrible two-handed club-like weapon that has to be seen to be
believed. Its handle is long and spiked on all sides but, residing at the end of this club and
seemingly growing there, is a screaming, burning human head! This head resembles a large bald
man with a gigantic open mouth, filled with teeth that have been filed to a point.

Add 1    FEARpoint.


Because this creature that wields this club is composed purely of magical armour and flame it
will be very difficult to do it any real damage. To demonstrate this you must, each time you win
an Attack Round, roll a die and consult the result. If the number rolled is 1-3 you have wounded
it in the normal way. If the result is 4-6 then your blow has failed to do it any real harm and will
cause it no damage.

If you suffer from Pyrophobia, you must deduct 1 from your Attack Strength for the duration of
this fight. You must also add yet another   FEARpoint. However, if it is your Primal Fear, you must
instead deduct 3 points from your Attack strength for this encounter. You must also add 3       FEAR
points rather than 1.

Alternatively, if you possess a pouch of unlimited contents and wish to use it, turn to 284. If you
do not possess such an item or do not wish to use it, you must fight the creature straight away.

You push the door open and walk straight into a scene of such sickening cruelty that you feel
your stomach tighten and twist

There are people being tortured here. A man's head and torso hangs from the ceiling by the flesh
of his face. He is still alive. Someone else has been boiled in a pit. Someone else has died of
cramp in a tiny cage, a look of agony on his face. Someone else is locked in a small cupboard,
with just enough room to lay down. He hasn't been fed in a long time and has started to eat his
own fingers.

Add a   FEARpoint.

One forgotten soul has had his arms and legs amputated and has then had massive rusty hooks
sunk into his face and been hung from the ceiling by them to die a horribly slow and painful
death.

Amidst all of this chaos stand two people. One is quite handsome and has a face and an air about
him almost of sophistication. The other has long hair at the sides but is bald on top. He also
sports a pair of glasses and a moustache. He has a certain knowing look about him as if he's
aware of something that you are not. Both of these men are dressed in butcher's costumes and
each of them is covered from head to foot in blood.

In front of them lays a table brimming with all manner of mobile phones, jewellery and MP3
players. No doubt these are the leftovers of the unfortunates that have been torn asunder in this
room.

The handsome one addresses you, &quot;Good evening my friend have you come to admire our
handiwork?&quot;

You tell them that you've actually come to kill them.


The long-haired balding one grins at your response, &quot;The people we are torturing are actually
members of the Brotherhood that have displeased Lord Yarles. So we are actually not quite as
bad as you might think.&quot;


Looking around you have to admit that there are quite a few blooded goat-head masks and black
cowls laying in the dirt and nailed to the walls.

The handsome one gives you a thin smile and rejoins with, &quot;Suffice to say if you so much as
think of attacking us we shall raise the alarm which my friend here will do in one second via that
bell-cord by his left arm.&quot;

There is indeed such a thing.

&quot;That I will,&quot; says the long-haired bald one. &quot;In fact we aren't too fond of the Brotherhood
ourselves and would rather hope that someone may go some way to destroying the uncouth
people.&quot;

&quot;That is quite correct if I might say so,&quot; interjects the handsome one, &quot;because for two pins we'd
kill the lot of them and would gladly help anyone who would do the same. Isn't that right?&quot;

&quot;It most certainly is if I might speak plainly,&quot; agrees Baldy, &quot;alas the brethren possess such
meagre offerings as to make it a financial waste of our time. Isn't that so?&quot;

&quot;I couldn't agree more,&quot; simpers Handsome. &quot;Still, needs must and we get to collect everything
we find and most certainly would not part with any of it for so much as a king's ransom let alone
a brass farthing if I might make so bold.&quot;

You sigh because you can barely understand their ridiculous way of speaking.

Baldy notices your confusion, &quot;This is no place for poor people.&quot;

&quot;Good evening to you,&quot; finishes Handsome.

You can't risk the alarm they may raise so you just shake your head in bewilderment and leave.

Upon reaching the left corner you turn and follow the carpet as it leads you forward and further
into the House. A bloody handprint is discernible on the right-hand wall but you do your best to
ignore it.

Resting in the left-hand wall is a door stamped with 'Tropaea' in golden letters. The wood they
are imbedded in is polished to a gleam so that you can even see a distorted and somewhat ghostly

The room beyond is full of workbenches, shelves of tools and even a grinding wheel. It is also
choked with dust and riddled with cobwebs, suggesting a lack of use for some considerable time.
Peering into the gloomy place, your eyes take in all manner of screwdrivers, hammers, discarded

You unlock the door and step cautiously through. This new room proves to be a well-lit richly
decorated affair, with a lush Persian carpet of thee deepest blue, intricately designed wallpaper
featuring some beautiful forest scene; polished antique mahogany furniture and an ornate Queen-
sized bed, replete with delicate carvings of fairies. You have seen some strange things in this
house but this room is all the stranger because of its very normality. Having said that there is an
unpleasant smell lingering about this place lending it a sense of unease.

Before you can investigate further a thought hits you: the curtains in this room are on the wrong
wall. That is to say that there cannot be window on the other side because it would just lead on to
the room next door. You walk up to these curtains, noting their deep red colour and the fact that
they reach from ceiling to floor, covering the entire wall in fact. If you wish to pull apart the

trees on the horizon and get the unnerving feeling that they're watching you back. Around the

start to moan. Getting ready to step back from the window your attention is suddenly caught by a

Grabbing a handful of newspapers, you sit yourself down at the table and recline in one of the
comfortable chairs for a read. For the most part the papers are full of the usual lies and
exaggeration. Ignoring the nonsense you soon come across a more worrying story in the local. It
tells of a disturbing amount of disappearances in the area and yet no clues as to whether they are
merely the 'norm': runaways, suicides and like or whether they are something more 'sinister'. You
read on and find something about a certain Lord Yarles, brother to the Earl of Drumer! It tells of
his 'many donations to charity' as well as his 'connections to the rich and powerful' and, although
it's only a 'rumour', his 'associations to heads of state including royalty'!

several pairs of long white arms stretching through the darkness, but they stop at this sunny

Astounded by all that is going on in this Reverse House you are pleasantly surprised to find an
attractive woman walking through the sunny area towards you. Sizing her up, alert for any signs

mention a face almost suspicious in its calmness.

Despite your suspicions you lower your guard and await the woman; admittedly somewhat tense.
She stops at arm's length from you and says, &quot;Ereh eb ot diputs ro evarb rehtie er'uoy.&quot;

Trying your best to decipher her backwards speech pattern, you are about to answer as best you

brimstone.

A flicker of movement to your north catches your attention and you notice an ancient bandaged
horror striding towards you shoulder to shoulder with the Horned Demon. Dumbfounded with
shock and frozen to the core with fear you can only wonder which fate will befall you first. Your
horrified question is soon answered as the door behind you is suddenly ripped off its hinges as a
tremendous heat rushes out at you. A single breath later and some sort of huge shaggy beast
launches itself at you with a roar that shakes the House; lifts you up off the ground with one
giant clawed hand and then rams you face-first down into its mouth. The last thing you see

Mumbled cries go up all around you as you step into a room void of all furniture and decoration
but brimming with people all locked together in a fight. Except that none of these people are
moving. Some of them are dressed like ordinary folk, whereas others are dressed in black robes
and are wearing some sort of goat-like masks. Yet here they all stand motionless, except for their
tearful eyes which follow you around the room. At first you take this to be another of Yarle's
'living death' tortures until you remember that some of those present are his people.

Upon looking closer you notice that each person has been hamstringed and then had all of their
bones broken so that they can barely move. They've then been literally nailed back together and
to the floor where they've then been posed to look as though they were fighting each other.

A sudden thought hits you: the Presence. An entity that has been accidentally brought forth
through the Gate and kills indiscriminately. Perhaps this is its handiwork. It's as if it's been
influenced by the torture it must have witnessed within the House and is now trying to imitate it?
You try imagine the Thing for a moment and wonder where it comes from and how it thinks, or
is it just an animal and composed of pure instinct?

Against your better judgement you fall asleep. How long you doze there for is difficult to say: an
hour, a day, a lifetime; what does it matter? So you let sleep take you and are soon surrounded by
dreams. Within these visions are the prominent and somehow familiar figures of a smiling old
man and woman dressed in old-fashioned Victorian clothes.

&quot;You are quite safe here,&quot; states the old man.

You ask him why.

&quot;You've noted I'm sure that this room and perhaps several others seem to be almost untouched
from the horrors of this House.&quot;

You nod in agreement.

&quot;That is usually because the Presence has been here and for reasons unknown cleared them out
as it were.&quot;


The Presence. You had forgotten all about that and say as much.

The old woman's eyes' twinkle, &quot;We don't think it's in the House right now but it's probably in
the grounds somewhere trying to possess something.&quot;

You blurt out that you need any help you can get from them to do with the Presence or the House
or Yarles or anything at all.

The old man laughs: a gentle little sound. &quot;We have noticed,&quot; says, &quot;that you have defeated the
Hell Demon and are now in possession of one of the three pieces of information to gain access to
Yarles' so-called 'Secret Room'. This, we are very pleased with. Don't forget though that there are
still two more and they will be guarded by two of his most trusted and dangerous allies.&quot;

&quot;His son and daughter,&quot; interrupts the old woman.

Yarles has children?

&quot;Of that we can now be sure,&quot; she continues, &quot;because we overheard Him saying as much to the
butler.&quot;

&quot;And they themselves may be guarded by other things,&quot; interjects the old man, &quot;not necessarily
other demons or such but perhaps a trap or a trick or the like.&quot;

A look of despair passes over your features and this does not go unnoticed by the old man, &quot;Your
mission is of course very difficult but not impossible, for even hell would not make it so because
that would break the rules of its so-called 'Game'.&quot;

You try to remain calm and tell them that you're going to need more than that to survive this
House.

&quot;You're going to need the Spear,&quot; says the old man with a serious look, &quot;Without it you are lost.
However there is another here in this House that could help you. She is in the library and her

Turning around, you are dumb-struck to find that the door you entered the Girl's room by is now

about the room and find that everything is now in the opposite place to where it was. You have
no idea what's happened but it's as if you are now somehow in the mirror-image of the House.
Looking back in terror to the mirror you see that the door 'reflected' in it is starting to open and

The door closes quietly behind you leaving you in darkness. Then a trickling sound can be heard,
getting louder and louder until it sounds like a waterfall. The darkness fades into light and you
are presented with what can only be a wall of blood in front of you. To your left and right and
behind you is now nothing but blackness.

You suspect that you have just found the entrance to the so-called 'secret room'.

Beyond the wall you can make out a large featureless stone room full of moving shadows that
writhe and twist into unnatural shapes. Still further, just beyond that room is what seems to be a
cave with a moving floor comprised of screaming crying shapes: the Well of Souls.

You must now attempt to pass through the Wall of Blood, Room of Shadows and the Well of
Souls alive and unharmed. This may only be achieved if you have all three pieces of 'secret'
information that Yarles' entrusted to his most loyal allies. Each one of these things has a number
inscribed upon it and you must now add all three numbers together and say the final number out
loud. Upon doing this you will be taken to a new reference which will make sense.

For a solid hour you trudge along this odd corridor, barely registering that it gradually turns into
a tunnel giving the strangest impression that you are now travelling underground. Behind you,
the tiniest flicker of the Death Spider's still burning web can be made out and someway in front
of it the merest hint of shine where some firelight bounces off the chapel door.

For another hour you trudge alone until nothing at all can be seen in the distance either way, only
darkness, until only you yourself are illuminated by a small circle of flickering light coming from
your burning torch.

For hours more you march wearily on until your mind becomes full of images of blood, shadows
and souls; not to mention so many questions about the House, the Gate, Yarles and the Spear.

Another hour and you stop in your tracks and contemplate this featureless tunnel, wondering if
Yarles built it like this using some dark magic, because it is obviously no longer in the House, or
even the estate anymore because it is simply much too long. This then begs the question of where
it actually is: hell, your mind, hyperspace? Perhaps though it's all a trick or an illusion or maybe
you are asleep and about to meet the Nightmare creature again, or you could have wandered into
that strange Reflected world once more and about to meet those long thin arms snaking out of the
darkness once more.

Then again, you muse, perhaps this is not Yarles' doing but the influence of the Presence. What
if it had somehow warped parts of the House just by being there? It's possible, you suggest to
yourself, but so is anything else.

For what seems like days you slowly walk along the never-changing tunnel, convinced that you
have left the House after all and are now underground or even in another dimension. Indeed your
mind starts to break a little when you notice that your torch never burns down no matter how
long you go on for.

For an instant your brain presents you with an image of you walking along this tunnel followed
by all those you have slain, as well as all those you could have saved but chose not too: a grisly,
gory army seeking their vengeance upon you once and for all, if only you'd look behind yourself
one last time, back into those days of shadows that are left in another world behind your back;
you would witness a bloody army limping and crawling, screaming and gnashing their teeth,
dragging their broken bodies ever closer to you, just waiting for the one single moment when
you would turn around, once last time.

Blink.

You find yourself in a corridor looking at a large expensive door sound-proofed with padding
within its frame. Upon the door is embroidered the words 'Studium'.

Behind you a short distance is the burning web and the chapel door.

You open the Studium door and walk in.

There is a study here on the other side with a large impressive, heavy and obviously ornate desk,
probably very old and worth a fortune. Behind the desk is big leather chair with wood polished to
a shine and a dragon carved onto each handle. In front of the desk is a smaller but still beautiful
chair, understated compared to the other and with a picture of a gate carved upon its back.

Against the walls are quite the collection of books, mostly small but one or two larger volumes
here and there. Around the room and illuminating it are four oil lamps carved in the likeness of
smiling demons.

There is an exit to the north entitled 'Defectus'. The wood is buckled, burned, broken and rotten
to the core. There is another exit to the right marked 'Scriba'. It's wood is fashioned far more

To your surprise you are led into a room that doesn't look particularly old-fashioned for once.
That is because lined in a row along the opposite wall are a trio of fairly modern looking washing
machines all whirring around and gently humming away. Beyond these innocuous noises you
can make out an irregular series of bumping sounds.

Bending down to look in the drums you quickly become aware of what is tumbling around
within the machines and have to speedily take your eyes away from watching those little dead
things churning around in there.

Approaching the little corridor, aware of arms sneaking through the shadows around you, you
step into anyway it and instantly bump into a short man dressed in animal furs and carrying a
heavy wooden club. You are about to speak when you observe that his face is clearly that of
some sort of Neanderthal and that speech would be irrelevant because he wouldn't understand a
single word. Unfortunately, in the second that it takes you to think this thought the man has
already hit you in the face with startling speed and animal ferocity.

You sink to the ground barely conscious and unable to see because of all the blood oozing into
your eyes. It's just as well then that you fail to notice the killing blow of the man as he breaks
your skull open with one almighty swipe.

After this the man grunts in satisfaction and then stalks off into the night...

You are transported to a some sort of giant glass tank in the middle of some sort of dark endless
zoo. Dozens of people surround the tank and are pointing and laughing at either you or its
contents, you can't be sure. Then the contents of the cage become apparent: insects of every
variety; ants, bees, moths, worms and beetles. Everywhere, they are everywhere crawling all
over you, Soldiers and Workers. A few faceless guards stand amongst the people and each of

You enter a well-stocked library.

Everywhere you look are shelves and shelves of books, stacked from floor to ceiling. Some of
these books are tiny and could fit in the palm of your hand, others are so large than you would
require another person to help you carry them. A few of them look bran new but most of them
look old and dusty. Indeed a handful of them look like they would fall to pieces if you dared to
handle them.

Dotted about the room are luxurious reading chairs decorated with a rich red upholstery, as well
as a single large divan resting in the corner and boasting the same red colour. An impressive
globe commands the centre of the floor and sits upon a golden stand. Here and there are busts of
famous thinkers such as Socrates, Plato and Confucius.

All in all this is a most impressive room and for some reason it seems untouched by hell.

Looking around you suddenly notice a small table next to one of the chairs with a few cakes and
biscuits on a silver tray upon it as well as a steaming mug of tea. Your instincts tell you that they
are likely to be safe considering the surroundings; and you are both famished and thirsty. You
drink the tea straight away.

No sooner have you started to examine the kaleidoscope of churning colours than your eyes hit
upon a small dot of red resting near one of the bottles. Of course you cannot wrench your gaze

You step into a smallish poorly-lit room with a rack of dresses along one wall, a beautiful
changing screen depicting swans in a pond along another and a dressing table and mirror with a
high-backed chair in front of you. Upon this dressing table is a silver platter with a small
selection of fruit.

When you reach out and take the fruit you are given a start when you become aware of a very old
woman dressed in a fashion more suited to a teenager sitting upon the chair. The old woman is
brushing her hair until her scalp bleeds and applying so much make-up as to make her withered
skin sore.

You try to stop her but she takes no notice of you and continues her self-torment whilst looking
at her reflection in the mirror.

She is crying.

As soon as you are across the threshold of this room thick smoke billows out and engulfs you,
even succeeding in swamping most of the short corridor outside. Yet a single sniff tells you that
no fire is the cause of such a substance, but rather you have just entered a Smoking Room and
have partook of a wall of tobacco smoke.

There are several comfortable armchairs positioned around the place and each one has a small
intricately decorated table next to it with a silver ashtray upon it and a few newspapers. None of
this interests you when you see that each chair holds a long-dead occupant whose mouth has
been utterly crammed with as many cigarettes as possible, no doubt until they've choked to
death. Each of these people also have dozens of cigarette burns over their faces. One unfortunate
man even has burns upon his eyes.

In the centre of all this is a larger than usual armchair that yet another forsaken man has been
chained naked to and has then, as far as you can tell, been used a means of stubbing out hundreds
or even thousands of cigarettes and cigars. He even has a pipe shoved deep into one of his eye
sockets.

However, even all of this horror doesn't account for the sheer amount of smoke that is choking
this place; so thick it is that the walls are lost within it even though they are scant meters away.
When you look at these walls, or at least try to look through the billowing substance all around


you, you could swear that there are things moving within it, just out of the corner of your eyes.
Although they seem to disappear when you try to look right at them.

Thinking of leaving in a hurry you spy a small red and black book with a roaring white dragon
motif upon its cover upon a nearby table instead of the usual newspapers. Scared but intrigued,
you take the book and notice that it is empty apart from the first page which is full of illustrations
and code words.

If you ever want to use try to use this 'dragon codebook' you must add 289 to the reference you

With a heavy heart you reach for your chosen weapon to help ease the man's journey from this
world. The man's eyes' light up when he sees that you mean to keep your word. He kneels in his
cage and just about manages to squeeze his face and most of his head through the filthy bars. &quot;I
realise that I don't deserve a quick death,&quot; he says with his eyes downcast, &quot;but I wish you well
for helping me on my way.&quot;

With those last words and making sure that the ragged man's eyes are tightly shut you finish him

Feeling that you've somehow done the right thing, even though it was far from pleasant, you

You are simply not strong enough to escape the thing behind you and, in a matter moments, the
ancient's tentacles have grabbed you and begun to drag you under. Then it begins to submerge
completely, pulling you into darkness and oblivion. You do not cry out. You do not move. Your
sanity has been shattered and you do nothing as it hauls you under.

The last the world ever witnesses of you is your doll-stiff, tear-streaked face as it disappears

All noise stops as you enter the darkness, even your own footfalls. All light fades as well, until
you are enveloped in a twisting silent sea of black until you don't know which way is up or down
let alone forward or black.

On the verge of passing out you become aware of a quartet of plain wooden doors each with a
bright red handle just appearing from nowhere within the blackness in front of you. Afraid yet
intrigued you walk silently up to the ordinary looking doors only to discover that they just hang
there in the air because there's nothing behind them.

As you walk back around to what you assume are their fronts you notice something that you
didn't before: each door has a small name inscribed upon its panels at just the point where a
keyhole would appear.

The first has 'FLEW WORE' upon it.
The second has 'KEEL TONS'
The third has 'TREES PC'.


Whilst the last has 'Don't know.'

Wracking your brains for moment as you stand there in an utter darkness devoid of all sounds
until you realise what you must do: the first three doors have anagrams upon them and you may
only pass through them if you solve these word puzzles. The forth you may pass through if you
don't know any of the others.

To do attempt to solve an anagram you must first decide which monster it secretly is and then
convert each letter of its name so that A=1, B=2, C=3 and so on. Once you think you've solved
the puzzle you will have come up with the correct name for a monster and a series of numbers.

Now examine the first and last letters that it has in its name and quadruple the values of those
letter only and ignore the values of the other letters. You will now have a new reference to turn
to and must do so at once. If the new reference makes sense, carry on. If it doesn't you must
come back here and try the 'Don't know' door.

You can only make one guess at one anagram.

If you fail in your single guess you have no choice but to open the 'Don't know' door. Turn to

Through the door there is a room with gaudily painted walls. There is also a selection of small
tables and chairs. Sitting upon these chairs and playing with filthy rags, bones and rusty knives
are a group of children. They do not laugh though, merely stare in horror at the awful 'toys' they
have to play with in the half-light.

There are what at first seems to be large dolls scattered around the room until you realise that
they are the actual mummified bodies of men and women; possibly the parents of these children.

Your eyes widen further when you take in several skeletons in the dusty corners of the room as
well as the gently swaying hanged corpses hidden amongst the shadows of the ceiling.

You harden your heart against this room of horror and leave.

Turn back to 347.

The southern door is decorated in a riot of colours giving it a rather gaudy yet still quite cheerful
impression. It has the word 'Theatrum' written in italics with a rainbow of colours on it.

You open in and are bathed in the light of moving images playing on a large screen bordered by
curtains in a dark room. The room is full of chairs and each chair has a man or a woman in it. To
your horror, they have all been nailed to the chairs. Not only this but their eyelids have been cut
off giving them all a truly awful bloodshot eye look. Their mouths have all been sewn shut too.
The torment must be unbearable. Yet when you lift your eyes to the screen and see what is
playing upon it you almost lose control of your stomach.

Upon the screen is a montage that plays in an endless loop. It features images of the men and
women in the room in a zombie-like state, and everyone of them is stabbing, strangling or simply
beating what you can only assume to be their own children. In other words these mothers and
fathers are being forced to watch themselves killing their own children. To you it is obvious that
they were in a trance and had no idea what they were doing, but to them it must be a fate worse
than death to be forced to watch this film over and over until they rot.

Of all the torment you have witnessed in this House, this one must rate as the most cruel.


You turn to leave this awful place when you become aware of two things: the first thing is that in
every single image on the screen is the fact that a key can be seen in all of them. The second is
that, on occasion, just for a micro-second, someone's arm actually comes through the screen as
she cuts her child down.

key.

As though in a living moving blob of blackness you wander on to your right, arms outstretched,
weapon at the ready. After a short while you enter what could be dead-end cave judging by the
echoes. There is a pleasant aroma here, together with some bubbling sounds.

Another sound hits your ears: a flopping squelchy slithering sound.

Something grabs your feet and pulls you, screaming, along the ground. A split-second later and
despite you thrashing widely about with your weaponry, the same something bites down over
your feet and your lower legs.

Your screams of agony and terror echo around the cave and smash back into you as the creature
draws you deeper and deeper into its sticky, oozing maw.

Luckily for you, you have already died of fright before it drags you in any further...

This entrance takes you to some European city or other, but the people do not speak, merely cry
and scream. Each of them possesses boils all over their body. You wonder why this is and then
dozens of rats burst from the shadows and start to eat everything: dogs, cats, people. In the
shadows stand some faceless rat-catchers, but they just stand motionless whilst the vermin
swarm over them. Looking up you watch as a million rats engulf the city. People scream.

With a firm grip on all three pieces of secret information you walk through the wall of blood and
yet not a single drop touches you. In fact the blood itself parts around you allowing you to walk
untouched under what must be hundred of gallons of the stuff because you walk through it for at


least a dozen meters and it extends on both sides of for a dozen more. Above you is a positive
waterfall of the stuff: the blood of thousands.

At last you break free of the substance and come across the dark stone room you saw earlier. In
here shadows move of their own accord and twist and tumble about you, but never touch you.
Some of the shadows look familiar: a horned head here, a bandaged arm there, a great skeletal
wing above and the images of goats below. Yet as you walk through the featureless room, each
and every shadow just swirls around you, never even attempting to make contact.

You pass through the stone room and become aware of a cavern with what seems to be a
colourful moving floor. When you move closer you see that the floor is composed of hundreds of
silent souls, all screaming at you to help them, to free them, to stop their pain. You set foot upon
this Well of Souls and each spirit instantly tries to get away from you, leaving you a free path
wherever you decide to tread, but that doesn't stop them for silently pleading with you and
begging you to end their torment.

After the Well of Souls cavern ends it features a single door in its far wall. The door is plain and
has no distinguishing marks, although it is burned to a crisp so that its handle flakes in your hand
as you pull the door towards you. Before you do, you notice a word scratched in the charcoal at
the top of the door 'Detecta'.

You are about to open it when the image of a skeleton dressed in fine robes, wearing a gold
crown and sitting on a large golden throne appears in front of the door, blocking your access.

&quot;I am the Questioner,&quot; intones a deep slow voice like the slamming of a coffin lid, &quot;and to allow
you access to Him I must ask you three questions.&quot;

You get the feeling that attacking this thing or ignoring it would be fatal so you resolve to listen
to its questions and hope that you have the answers.

&quot;The first question has to do with weaponry. The second has to do with keys. The third has to do
with the names of doors. You may only have one guess at each of them and may only progress to
the next question if you answer the previous correctly.&quot;

You try to digest this information realising that your life almost certainly depends on it.

&quot;My first question,&quot; asks the skeleton, &quot;is how many weapons is it possible for you to use in this
House?&quot;

You think for a while and then you say the number out loud. Now you must turn to the reference
that matches the number you think it is.

If the number you turn to doesn't make any sense then you are wrong and the skeleton will warp
you back to the vampire's room and wipe your memory of any encounters subsequent to that,
except that this time you won't have the Master's key. Turn to 498 if this becomes the case.

The woman's smile fades when she perceives that you won't touch the paper. &quot;Neht reH ot uoy

sunlight and into darkness and you watch in horror as a multitude of thin white arms snake
around her and drag her from you.

Your horror strengthens when you realise that the patch of sunlight is now dwindling and that
dozens of hands are reaching for you, closer and closer.

It quickly dawns on you that the broken quarterstaff that you chanced upon earlier is actually one
half of the Spear of Destiny! You do as the man asks and marvel as the Spear fits together
perfectly and joins almost as if it had never been broken.

Add 2  LUCK  points and deduct 2  FEARpoints.

You wind any blessed ribbons around it if you have any of them then suddenly become aware
that the priest has slumped to the floor. You run to him and ask him if he's OK.

His barely open eyes regard you sleepily, &quot;I've only stayed alive long to give this to you. I
haven't eaten in weeks and I drank the font dry days ago.&quot;

You race to find him something to eat and drink but even in the few moments it takes you to rifle
through your things the priest has already died. You look at him and are startled to find him
looking skeletally thin and completely dehydrated, as if he died a month ago. You close his eyes
and leave the chapel with renewed determination.

Like a great red tongue the carpet takes you left and soon arrives at a corner that beckons you
northwards. Behind you sitting in the south wall is a door with 'Scalptura' engraved lovingly onto
the door where it features long sloping letters looping through one another. Ahead of you is a

On past the Requiesce room you enter back into the second horizontal passageway within the
House. Here you are at the extreme right end of it and to your left it continues on for some
distance, lit here and there by a few more flickering chandeliers. Once more you begin to pad
slowly along the carpet, trying your best to ignore a few dripping red patches on the walls.
Peering into its shadows to the left you can make out three corridors heading off to the north and
three more heading back to the south. As you are making up your mind a ghostly laughter drifts
towards you from behind you. Shivering, you resolve not to head back and must quickly head
elsewhere. You realise you have a number of choices:

Through the doorway you are instantly transported to what can only be described as an old
fashioned hall of mirrors show in some dingy forgotten circus. Everywhere you look there are
people peering into mirrors of all shapes and sizes and then screaming in horror. This is strange
because these faceless people, like vampires, do not have reflections. Trying to ignore the
dozens, hundreds, thousands of mirrors is difficult because no matter where you look a new one
appears, and the tent seems endless anyway. If you suffer from Catoptrophobia, turn to 414. If

The iron door creaks open on rusty hinges and the moment that it does so a black-garbed man
runs next to you from the area within and slams the door shut. The man is has a white collar
about his neck and is clearly some sort of priest. He looks at you with wide bloodshot eyes whilst
holding your shoulders with shaking hands. His hair is unkempt and his face is unshaven and yet
despite his appearance you feel that you can trust him.

Behind the man and all around you is what could only be an in-House chapel as some of the
Victorians used to have back in their day. You do a double-take.

Why on earth would Yarles have a chapel in this House?

You raise your eyes a moment in contemplation.

Unless, he wants to mimic the real world as much as possible even right down to the things he
hates or fears?

You calmly take the priest's hands off your shoulders, still feeling you can trust him. He just
stands there staring at you with a look of undisguised disbelief upon his face.

The chapel has a small altar at one end with a large crucifix on the wall behind it. About the
room and letting in a little colourful moonlight are a few stain glass windows of various saints


such as George slaying the dragon. In front of the altar are a few rows of pews with some
cushions below them. There's even a baptismal font between the altar and the pews.

You ask the priest about finding a church in this House of all places.

For a moment he doesn't seem to have heard you, then he shakes his head as if waking from a
dream and answers, &quot;Yarles thought the Spear would be safe in here from anyone and anything
but he was too stupid to realise that I had altered his plans and had a solid iron door put here
instead of the wooden one he had expected.&quot;

You raise an eyebrow.

&quot;They hate iron.&quot;

You have heard stories that iron is the enemy of the Devil, but surely Yarles is just a man?

&quot;When the Spear broke the first time he tried to open the Gate he thought he'd put it here for
safekeeping even from his own kind. He trusts no one, not even his own son or daughter when it
comes to the Spear. That's why he was going to leave it here for the next time he attempted to
open the Gate.&quot;

You stop in your tracks and ask him what on earth the Gate is and where the hell you can find it.

&quot;The gate is the front door and it has been there longer than humankind has existed. It changes its
appearance over the centuries and the millennia so as to better fit in with its surroundings.&quot;

You argue with him that it's just an ordinary door and that you've been through it from both sides
and that nothing happened.

&quot;That is because it requires a sacrifice to open it to the correct place, or it is just an ordinary
door.&quot;

You are dumbfounded but thank him for his explanation and ask him to continue with his story.

&quot;One of us brought one half of the Spear downstairs somewhere and I ran upstairs with the other
half. In all the confusion, the blood, the pain, the suffering, no one really saw us and didn't even
try to stop us.&quot;

One half of the Spear is here?

The priest sees the delight dawn on your face, &quot;Indeed it's true I have the top half of it right
here.&quot; He produces from within his robes a short broken spear with a very rusty head. &quot;It doesn't
look like much but then it is about two thousand years old.&quot;

He hands it to you.

You take it almost greedily and hold something that few have ever done so.

Add 1  LUCK   point and deduct 1 FEARpoint.

&quot;If you have the other half I advise you to put them together.&quot;

If you think you have the other half of the Spear you will then know that it has a number upon it.
Deduct that number from this reference and turn to that new number now to use it.

If you do not have it, you slump to the ground in utter disbelief: you have failed in your mission.
You suddenly become aware that the priest has slumped to the floor too. You look at him and are
startled to find him looking skeletally thin and completely dehydrated, as if he died a month ago.


You wonder how long you will last in this chapel. Outside, on its door, a heavy thumping sound
can be now heard as something starts to hammer away at the door. Dust falls to the floor and the
masonry around the frame shakes.

For reasons unknown to you the image of a smiling creature with a head like a lump of raw meat
comes floating unbidden into your mind...

She falls to the ground and, startlingly, shatters into a thousand glittering pieces, her last defiant
scream echoing for some seconds afterwards. You wipe your brow and decide that you've spent
more than enough time in her domain.

You open the iron door and wince as its creaks echo up and down the tunnel for some moments.
Just as you are doing this several raggedly-dressed figures run out and begin to thank you
profusely for releasing them. You have no idea what to say or even if you should trust them but
before you can think of arming yourself one of them thrusts a very large golden key into your
hands decorated with a pair of folded pristine white gloves. Just the sort of things a butler would
wear.

Before you can even pocket the butler's key, the ragged people run back off up the tunnel
towards the moonlight whooping with joy.

The door opens onto an indoor swimming pool, except that the water is absolutely filthy and has
at least a dozen rotten corpses floating within it. As you stand there looking at those foul waters
choked with dead bodies you can't help but get the feeling that you are having a small glimpse
into the punishments of hell.

Shaking off the horrible feeling you notice a flicker of movement within the grimy waters:
something is alive in there. Whatever it is it sends ripples amongst the filth and disturbs the
remains of the dead leaving them gently rocking in its wake and further polluting the water with
their blood.

Suddenly a great eruption bursts amongst the dead, showering the sides of the pool with their
remains and forms itself into a towering watery giant complete with horns and claws. Then,
without warning it rushes at you.


If you suffer from Aquaphobia you must add 1     FEAR point.

If it's your Primal Fear you must add 2      FEAR  points and leave now and continue along the
corridor, turn to 321 to go north or 26 if you wish to press onwards then right, turn to 26.

a pouch marked 'limitless', turn to 448.

You have no means of opening the door.

What happens next is instantaneous.

Whispering and laugher fill the air as does the sound of crying and screaming. Through all of this
you can just about make out the distant tolling of a bell, but warped as if it were being played
backwards. Around you the walls start to bleed and bones start to fall from the ceiling. Below
you the floor crumbles into flame.

It would seem that touching this lock, perhaps the final lock in this House without a key triggers
one last deadly trap.

So there you stand watching the walls bleed and the bones disappear into the flames below. You
think of leaving but the door you entered by has simply vanished leaving you no known exit
from this place.

Then the ceiling starts to lower of its own accord, pushing you, the blood and the bones into the
flames below.

Before the pain and the horror become too great you succeed in cutting your own throat, hoping
against hope that you can escape the appalling punishments that await you Below...

                                                499
The entrance guides you into quite a small yet cosy dining area that is no doubt reserved for
servants, judging by how meagrely it is decorated, for there is little more here than a fireplace, a
rickety wooden table and a few old lopsided chairs. Standing in the room is a plump smiling
gentleman who appears both totally normal and completely unarmed. Strangely enough you find
yourself more on edge because of his very apparent normality.

You ask him who he is in an obviously suspicious voice.

&quot;Who I am ish of no relevanshe!&quot; he lisps, beaming at you. &quot;You, on the other hand are of the
utmosht importanshe.&quot;

You ask him what he means, your expression still hard.

&quot;You're here to shtop Him aren't you?&quot; he claps his hands together. &quot;I ashume you know that he
keepsh himshelf locked up in his 'shecret room' don't you?&quot;

You nod in agreement.

&quot;Of courshe you do,&quot; he says with a laugh and claps his hands a second time. &quot;Then I'm shure
that you know you require three objectsh to get there and that all three of them are guarded by
hish mosht trushted alliesh.&quot;


Another nod.

&quot;Well one of them ish very closhe, at the end of thish corridor in fact. He holdsh the firsht of the
shecret informashtion that you'll need but he won't jusht hand it over to you ash I'm shure you've
guesshed. Well he himshelf is guarded by a couple of shecrets of his own. Firsht, you'll need to
find the key to hish room and nexsht you'll need to find the weapon that he'sh vulnerable to.&quot;

You ask the plump man why on earth this first 'secret holder' would keep a weapon that he's
vulnerable to just lying around the house.

&quot;Well firshtly it'sh not in the houshe, it'sh under it, in the shellar. Shecondly, it'sh hish link to hell
and he can't shtray too far from it or he'll be thrown right back there and his mastersh won't be
too pleashed. Thirdly, I hashard a guessh that the weapon is not jusht 'lying around' the cellar but
ish in fact guarded by sheveral trapsh and God knowsh what elshe. Truth be told I've heard that
there'sh one final trap placshed on the weapon itshelf but that it only triggersh oncshe you leave
itsh domain. Shomething about 'darknessh' or whatever that I overheard the butler talking to
Yarlesh about.&quot;

You shake your head in disbelief at all of this information and tell him that you've a difficult
time taking it all in.

The plump man claps his hands together, &quot;I think you know I'm telling the truth! Pleashe, leave
the Houshe now and get to the shellar, find hish key and the weapon and get back up here. Even
if you trigger the final trap I've a friend that might be able to help you! He'sh locked in the next
room yonder but I have the key. You'll recognishe him by hish shpeach impeidment,&quot; he says
with a knowing laugh, &quot;He hash a shtutter!&quot; He claps his hands together, &quot;L-like th-that!&quot;.

You raise an eyebrow.

&quot;I've told him about you and your objective and alsho what you look like sho he'sh exshpecting
you!&quot;

You're not sure what to make of all this and tell the man as much.

&quot;No time for argument,&quot; he says with a friendly wink. With those last words he ushers you
gently out of the room and before you can protest, he has shut and locked the door.

For a little while you stand there and try to take in all you've heard but you're not totally sure
how much to believe him or anything he's said.

Just then slow thudding footsteps can be heard pounding relentlessly along the carpet from the
right but you can't tell if their coming from the passage in front or behind you. Either way the
footsteps bring with them the ancient musty smell of death. As if that weren't enough you can
now make out the rustling noise of bandages rubbing together.

One of your old enemies has found you and you know you can't possibly face it in combat and
that you can't risk meeting it yet. You decide that perhaps you should trust the plump man's
words after all. This means you should leave the House right now or try to hide from this enemy
first. So you have a split-second decision to make.

If you wish to knock on the plump man's door again, turn to 48.
If you run to the front door, turn to 149.
If you run to the back door, turn to 157.
If you try to barricade yourself in a nearby room, turn to 247.
